This includes information on segments and industries such as mobile internet usage, market reach, device usage, app reach as well as statistics on demographics and use. Mobile internet refers to the use of internet-connected applications and browsing the web on mobile devices. For many years internet access has only been possible with a fixed line. In the last couple of years however, mobile internet use has moved out of the niche and onto the mass market. As of 2013, almost a third of website traffic originated from mobile devices. Currently, more than 100 million users in the United States access the internet via tablet or smartphone. Furthermore, the number of mobile-only internet users worldwide is expected to close in on half a billion users. Apple set the bar for future smartphones when it released the first iPhone in 2007. In 2010, Apple introduced the iPad and has since been dominating the tablet market as well. Google followed suit, releasing the Android OS which is currently the most popular smartphone operating system on the planet. The Apple App Store and Google Play are also the leading mobile app stores worldwide and account for over 90 percent of worldwide app revenues. Between the two competitors, Google Play\u2019s market share is steadily growing and has doubled within the previous year. Mobile internet usage statistics show that users spent most of their online time writing and reading emails. Other popular activities include social networking, catching up with news and current events, mobile gaming, and mobile media consumption via content streaming apps such as Netflix or Spotify. The popularity of mobile internet has created a new market for advertisers as well. Mobile advertising revenues are growing quickly and mobile advertising is expected to grow into a billion-dollar business in the next few years.

In established markets such as the US, competition at mass-market level has become more intense, but is lessening at the market\u2019s premium level. Market growth is fuelled by consumers investing in their gardens as an extension of the home, with outdoor furnishings seen as a way to add value to the home. Television shows and lifestyle magazines promoting home makeovers are also contributing to market growth. Fashion trends dictate the market to a large extent, with neutral colors, an elegant, luxurious look and simple designs proving popular. The DIY market has seen growth in recent years as consumers under pressure due to the economic crisis opt to carry out home improvements themselves rather than paying for professional home improvement help. Leading players operating in the US home improvement retail market include Lowes, Home Depot, True Value, Ace Hardware and Menard.

In 2014, the population of India was forecast to reach over 1.25 billion people. After having gained independence within the British Commonwealth in 1947, a new constitution was proclaimed on January 26, 1950 and the Republic of India was established. India is a federal republic consisting of 28 states and seven union territories. The country\u2019s parliamentary democracy is considered to be the largest democracy in the world. India\u2019s economy has been subject to considerable growth since its liberation in the early 1990s. India\u2019s GDP growth rate has consistently been well above five percent for the last ten years. As a result of its growth, the country\u2019s economy is the eighth largest in the world according to this 2014 GDP country ranking. Data from the IMF suggests that India\u2019s GDP is set to hit 2.3 trillion U.S. dollars in 2014. India has a large and highly skilled workforce. The country\u2019s reputation as a breeding ground for IT specialists and the relatively low wage levels make India a very popular destination for outsourcing. Though economic progress continues to be made, India still struggles with issues such as poverty and illiteracy. The literacy rate among adults in India was only 63 percent in 2006 according to Worldbank statistics. Parts of India\u2019s population continue to suffer the consequences of the caste system which still impedes social mobility to a large extent. The fact that a substantial part of the population still lives in poverty is reflected in India\u2019s life expectancy. Though steadily improving, life expectancy for Indians born in 2012 was only 66 years compared to 79 years in the United States and 75 years in China.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores The Netherlands is located in North-West Europe, sharing borders with Belgium and Germany. The country is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy, with the beautiful city of Amsterdam as its capital. For its size, the Netherlands is quite densely populated with an average of 492 inhabitants per square kilometer. This is reflected in the population and in 2012, statistics show that the country\u2019s population has reached 16.77 million. An extremely low lying nation, 20 percent of the Netherlands, along with 21 percent of its population, lie below sea level. With 50 percent of its land lying less than one meter above sea level, flooding presents a serious risk to the population resulting in a series of projects known as the Delta works. Even though it suffered extensive devastation during the Second World War, the Netherlands started to prosper soon after, forging a close relationship with its neighbors, as well as the United States. As a result, the country was at the forefront of several major initiatives including the founding of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) in 1949, the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951 and the European Economic Community in 1958, which eventually evolved into the European Union. In 2012, the Netherlands is recognized as one of the world\u2019s most liberal nations. A relaxed drug policy, legal euthanasia and an allowance for same-sex marriage have all become notable features of Dutch culture. The Netherlands has a modern, developed economy with an educated workforce, focused primarily on the chemical industry, metallurgy, and electrical goods. Its location ensures easy access to key markets in the UK and Germany, as well as the rest of continental Europe. Well known Dutch companies include Heineken, Shell and Philips. A knowledge-based economy with significant English language skills has proven attractive to foreign investors, and none more so than the United States. Statistics show that the United States has invested heavily in the Netherlands over the last decade, contributing billions to the economy. Ripples from the worldwide financial crisis have been felt in the Netherlands, but it has not suffered as badly as neighboring countries. Over the past four years, unemployment has risen slightly with figures showing that the official level now stands at 5.5 percent. A 2011 WTO ranking of the largest exporting countries listed the Netherlands as the fifth-largest merchandise exporter worldwide, and the country has a GDP per capita of 47,841.92 U.S. dollars in 2012.

Like its neighbors, the British economy has suffered due to the global financial crisis. In 2008, the economy officially entered recession for the first time since 1991. Between 2008 and 2009, the unemployment rate in the UK rose from 5.56 percent to 7.45 percent. By 2013, it had reached 8.11 percent. The level of national debt has also risen significantly since the onset of the financial crisis, reaching 1.5 trillion pounds by 2013. Despite this however, the UK still enjoys a very high standard of living with a GDP per capital of 39,883 U.S. dollars.

Although it has one of the lowest population densities in the world, with only 8.4 inhabitants per square kilometer, it is still one of the most populous countries, with almost 144 million inhabitants. Russia\u2019s population is mostly urban (271343), with more than 73 percent of its inhabitants living in cities, of which the capital Moscow is the largest, with almost 12 million residents. St. Petersburg, the former capital of the empire, still remains an important economical and cultural hub and is home to over 5 million people. The unemployment rate has fluctuated in the past decade, reaching its peak in 2009, at 8.4 percent, but has slowly decreased to 5.6 percent in 2014. Life expectancy at birth has been constantly increasing, reaching an average of 69 years in 2011. Today, the Russian Federation, which succeeds the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, is a semi-presidential federal republic. It is formally structured as a multi-party representative democracy, although international observers consider it a centralized semi-authoritarian state under the rule of President Vladimir Putin, who first assumed office in 2000. A worldwide survey of leadership performance approval ratings for the United States, China, Russia, United Kingdom and Germany governments, shows Russian leadership to be the least popular. Due to a number of political and military moves, such as the 2014 annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol, the current politics of Russia are criticized by many governments, international organizations and private citizens. Russia is one of the world's leading producers and exporters of oil, natural gas, metals, wood, chemicals, and a wide variety of civilian and military manufactures. Its main export partners are the Netherlands, China and Germany. It imports mostly vehicles, pharmaceutical products, plastic, meat, fruits and nuts, as well as optical and medical instruments from its closest import partners, such as China, Germany and Ukraine. It is also one of the four BRIC countries, a group that unites Brazil, Russia, India and China, due to their similar stage of economic development. In 2014, the gross domestic product of Russia amounted to over 2 trillion U.S. dollars, which placed the country amongst the top 10 countries with the largest GDP in the world. The GDP growth rate however has been declining from 4.5 percent in 2010 to 0.24 percent in 2014. Furthermore, the devaluation of the Russian ruble and a decrease in oil prices caused an overall decline of the economic growth towards the end of 2014 and subsequent forecasts of a negative GDP growth in 2015.

These segments are complementary and through their diversity they are able to satisfy all consumers\u2019 needs and expectations with regard to cosmetics. Beauty products can be also subdivided into premium and mass production segments, according to the brand prestige, price and distribution channels used. Over the years to come, the cosmetics and personal care industry is predicted to record gains across the board, with particularly strong growth expected for sun protection and anti-aging products as consumers become increasingly aware of the dangers of sun exposure and more concerned with preserving a youthful appearance. Emerging nations represent huge potential for international companies, offering better quality products than locally produced goods to populations with rising income levels. Multinational companies have begun establishing a strong foothold in countries such as Russia, India and China. Rising income means that consumers are more concerned with product effectiveness and ingredients used than cheap products. Manufacturers are therefore focused on advertising their products as superior to those of rival companies, rather than systematically seeking to undercut market prices. Distribution channels are changing in that cosmetic brands are available not only in retail outlets like department stores, but also through internet purchasing, television infomercials, home shopping, airport vending machines and in spas.

Within the sector there is a scale polarisation at both the business and the store level. The leading retailers are huge, multi-national businesses which dominate the sector. They operate a range of stores from major hypermarkets and supercenters through to small convenience stores. Personal income, consumer confidence, and interest rates drive demand. The profitability of individual companies depends on efficient supply chain management and effective merchandising and marketing. Large companies have advantages in purchasing, distribution, and marketing. Small companies can compete effectively by selling unique merchandise, providing superior customer service, offering a distinctive shopping experience, or serving a local market. Retailing is also significant it its social dimension as well. Whilst economically retailing bridges production and consumption, in social terms it effects most of the population every day. It is the rare person who does not go shopping, or indeed has not worked in retailing or been involved in it in some way. For some, retailers offer their major social intercourse of the day or week and act as a social network, setting or center.

Retailers have also extended their tasks to encompass the supply chain and intermediaries and suppliers are effectively managed and controlled by the retailers\u2019 channel dominance.

The industry overlaps with other markets like chemical, health care, and petroleum. The latter is important as personal care product raw materials, such as propylene glycol, come from petroleum products. The global personal care products industry is concentrated in nature, with the EU, US, UK, Brazil and Russia dominating the industry. Just as consumer awareness leads to a trend towards organic and herbal products, greater corporate awareness means companies are committing to environmental protection by reducing packaging, conserving water, reducing carbon emissions and stressing recycling. As a result, companies have built eco-smart facilities, and research and distribution buildings. Over the coming years companies are likely to continue investing in eco-friendly practices. Manufacturers will also respond to demand for more natural products, widening their natural and herbal product lines. Marketing efforts will likely be increasingly geared to stress environmental protection and respect for hair and skin through non-toxic ingredients. Key players in the world oral hygiene market include GlaxoSmithKline, Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive. Leading companies in the global fragrance market include L\u2019Or\u00e9al, Est\u00e9e Lauder, Inter Parfums, and Avon Products.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores Nonmetallic minerals are a special group of chemical elements from which no new product can be generated if they are melted. Nonmetallic minerals are, for example, sand, gravel, limestone, clay, and marble. Such materials lack metallic characteristics like good electric and thermic conductivity, luster, rigor, and malleability; they are, however, essential for many industries. The nonmetallic minerals industry is best known for the production of cement, ceramics, glass, and lime products. Thus, the range of application is quite broad, from construction materials to sanitary ware to tableware and decorative products. The transformation of nonmetallic minerals into these products is often an energy-intensive process, which can include several steps, such as heating, grinding, mixing, cutting, shaping and honing. In the United States, the Nonmetallic Mineral Products Industry was formerly known as the Stone, Clay, Glass, and Concrete Products Industry. Under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), this subsector is separated into clay product and refractory, glass and glass products, cement and concrete products, lime and gypsum products, and other nonmetallic mineral products.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores In this section, Statista presents the most relevant and up-to-date facts relating to the construction industry. The construction industry refers to the building of edifices and infrastructure in the following sectors: residential, commercial, environmental and energy, industrial, transportation and defense. Construction projects are typically designed, co-ordinated and supervised by construction managers. China\u2019s CRCC, Spain\u2019s ACS Group and France\u2019s Vinci are counted among the world\u2019s leading companies in this field. All the minor and huge tasks on a construction site need to be carried out by a specialist. As a result, there is often an army of subcontractors involved in a construction project. Subcontractors are enterprises that cover the full spectrum of construction jobs, ranging from masonry work to painting, carpentry, plumbing and electrical installation. Each project requires the deployment of a number of construction machines and the use of a variety of building materials. The most important building materials include gypsum and wallboard, cement and concrete, ferrous metals, wood, plastics, as well as stone and clay. Ireland\u2019s CRH and Luxembourg\u2019s ArcelorMittal can be named as the major producers of building materials. In terms of construction equipment, the major categories include crawler excavators and dozers, wheel loaders, graders, aerial work platforms and cranes. US-based Caterpillar, Japan\u2019s Komatsu and Sweden\u2019s Volvo are the biggest players in the construction equipment business.

It is a multibillion-dollar global enterprise devoted to the business of making and selling clothes. Some observers distinguish between the fashion industry (which makes \u201chigh fashion\u201d) and the apparel industry (which makes ordinary clothes or \u201cmass fashion\u201d), but by the 1970s the boundaries between them had blurred. Fashion is best defined simply as the style or styles of clothing and accessories worn at any given time by groups of people. The fashion industry has tremendous variety of products, small product life cycles, unpredictable and volatile demand, inflexible and long supply procedures. There may appear to be differences between the expensive designer fashions shown on the runways of Paris or New York and the mass-produced sportswear and street styles sold in malls and markets around the world. However, the fashion industry encompasses the design, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, retailing, advertising, and promotion of all types of apparel (men\u2019s, women\u2019s, and children\u2019s), The term \u201cfashion industries\u201d is used to refer to myriad industries and services that employ millions of people internationally. The fashion industry connects people from across the planet and is one of the most profitable markets in the world.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores The industry Fisheries & Aquaculture comprises all economic branches around fish farming for food production or further processing. The sector is divided into commercial and recreational fishing and comprises the harvesting, processing and marketing of fish. The commercial part may involve the capture of wild fish or the raising of fish by using aquaculture. The commercial fishing methods vary considerably, from using large nets, pole and line, trolling with single lines and traps or pots. According to the definition of the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), fishing gear is divided in active and passive catching gear. In order to avoid catching endangered or unwanted species, commercial fishing gear is specifically designed and regularly updated according to the latest scientific findings. The fishing industry in the United States is mainly concentrated on the Pacific Coast. Based on total US fishery landings, major domestic species include pollock, menhaden and cod. Recent trends shaping this agricultural sector include sustainable and responsible fishing. Overfishing of the ocean and the loss of biodiversity has led to the protection of endangered species.

Finance is the breath of the world and - without it, life as we know it would come to a grinding halt. Finance, insurance and real estate are necessities that ensure affect our safety, security and comfort. They are aspects of our lives to which we give little thought but which would leave a gaping and immediate hole if they were to cease to exist. They form the platform on which we build our lives, provide us with the means to do so, and supply us with a safety net, if for some reason the platform should break apart beneath our feat. Banking and finance form a major part of the financial sector and include a broad range of institutions offering a plethora of services aiming to deal with the financial needs of their clients - be they individuals, corporations or national governments. Financial markets and their fluctuations form the basis of any capitalist society and the many ways in which their shifts affect our daily lives is ever present. Financial markets enable people to trade securities, commodities and other fungible items at prices that reflect supply and demand. Insurance is another very important aspect of the financial services industry. Insurance, in a nutshell, constitutes the transfer of risk from one entity to another in exchange for payment. This loss can take numerous forms - for every form there is an insurance policy to cover it. From life and health insurance to auto and life, any risk that can be quantified can potentially be insured. Insurance can even be purchased by reinsurers to further displace the risk. Insurance is as important as it is financially mighty and has an important role to play in the economic recovery.

The education system in the United States begins with pre-kindergarten and can go through graduate school. Educational attainment and achievement are monitored and evaluated throughout primary and secondary school (elementary school through high school), often with benchmark testing that can have an effect on a school\u2019s funding. Post-secondary educational institutions (community colleges, colleges, universities, and professional schools), while broad-ranging in terms of people served and topics available for study, have a growing reputation for their exorbitant costs and the amount of loans that students must take out in order to fund their education, and there is increased discussion about the actual worth of a college degree in terms of employability and future income. The statistics that are provided in the education section range over topics as diverse as school demographics, bullying, performance and benchmarks, success rates, enrollment, funding, costs, student loans and debt, income and salaries, majors and degree types, rankings, institutions, educational structures, technology, and classroom conditions, among others. Closely related to the field of education is science and research. Research facilities are often (but not always) attached to educational institutions, and some information, such as funding and demographics, may have some overlap with educational statistics. Other topics covered in the science and research section include research and development spending (public and private), research fields, employment outlook, research conditions, patents, and Nobel Prize winners.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), health systems have to \u201cpromote, restore and maintain health\u201d. This includes not only direct health-improving measures, it also incorporates indirect factors which influence healthcare. Financing is a particularly crucial issue for health systems. All medical services, as well as medical equipment, health education etc., have to be paid for by somebody. Primary financial sources of health systems around the world are taxes, public and private health insurances, out-of-pocket payments and donations. Most countries have elements of all these funds included in their health system financing. The United States has the highest healthcare costs worldwide, both per capita and as a percentage of its gross domestic product. High health costs are a major reason for 50 million U.S. Americans without health insurance in 2010. The largest share of U.S. healthcare provision and spending comes from governmental programs like Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare, Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, and the Veteran Health Administration. Additionally, healthcare facilities in the United States are largely in the hands of private businesses.

Cr\u00e9ation pour contenu et design pour vos projets :  En savoir plus KPIs de 10.000 magasins en ligne Plus de 14 000 entreprises font d\u00e9j\u00e0 confiance \u00e0 Statista Dans le but de contester le projet de r\u00e9forme des retraites men\u00e9 par le Pr\u00e9sident Emmanuel Macron et son gouvernement, plusieurs organisations syndicales et de jeunesse ont appel\u00e9 les Fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 se mobiliser le 5 d\u00e9cembre 2019 et les ont invit\u00e9s \u00e0 faire une gr\u00e8ve g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et nationale. Cette statistique montre l'opinion des Fran\u00e7ais en fin novembre 2019 quant \u00e0 la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de cette gr\u00e8ve naitonale. Il s'av\u00e8re que la majorit\u00e9 des sond\u00e9s, soit 64\u00a0%, trouvaient ce mouvement justifi\u00e9, contre 36\u00a0% qui le trouvaient infond\u00e9. Le syst\u00e8me des retraites en France Consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme complexe, le syst\u00e8me de retraite fran\u00e7ais est l'un des rares fond\u00e9 sur le principe de r\u00e9partition\u00a0: reposant sur le principe de solidarit\u00e9 entre les g\u00e9n\u00e9rations, les actifs versent chaque mois des cotisations aux caisses de retraite qui les redistribuent aux retrait\u00e9s actuels. Le r\u00e9gime obligatoire combine deux types de retraites (la retraite de base et la retraite compl\u00e9mentaire). Le gouvernement d'\u00c9douard Philippe tient \u00e0 r\u00e9former ce syst\u00e8me, notamment avec la mise en place d\u2019un r\u00e9gime de base par points (sur le m\u00eame mod\u00e8le que la retraite compl\u00e9mentaire) dans lequel le montant de la retraite serait calcul\u00e9 en fonction des points accumul\u00e9s au cours de la vie professionnelle. Par ailleurs, les r\u00e9gimes sp\u00e9ciaux seraient supprim\u00e9s au rofit d'un r\u00e9gime de retraite universel. Pour autant, les Fran\u00e7ais sont 66\u00a0% \u00e0 ne pas faire confiance \u00e0 Emmanuel Macron pour r\u00e9former les retraites. Emmanuel Macron et la contestation S'il n'est pas le seul pr\u00e9sident de la V\u00e8me R\u00e9publique \u00e0 avoir affront\u00e9 une grogne grandissante, M. Macron pourrait bien \u00eatre le chef d'\u00c9tat fran\u00e7ais ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moin des manifestations parmi les plus violentes et les plus \u00e9tir\u00e9es dans le temps. Le mouvement des Gilets jaunes a eu beau s'\u00e9tioler au fil des mois, il a dur\u00e9 huit mois cons\u00e9cutifs. En plus d'une c\u00f4te de popularit\u00e9 inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 50\u00a0%, 76\u00a0% des Fran\u00e7ais trouvent sa politique injuste et 67\u00a0% pensent que les \u00e9lus sont \u00e9loign\u00e9s des pr\u00e9occupations des Fran\u00e7ais. Pourtant, ces pr\u00e9occupations sont nombreuses\u00a0: baisse du pouvoir d'achat, ch\u00f4mage, pr\u00e9carit\u00e9, manque de moyens des h\u00f4pitaux publics, crise climatique... La France est en proie \u00e0 de nombreuses tensions que le gouvernement peine \u00e0 calmer. Organis\u00e9 par l'Association fran\u00e7aise contre les myopathies (AFM), le T\u00e9l\u00e9thon est devenu le plus important \u00e9v\u00e9nement caritatif de l'Hexagone depuis sa mise en place en 1986. Chaque ann\u00e9e, le T\u00e9l\u00e9thon a lieu au cours de la premi\u00e8re ou la deuxi\u00e8me fin de semaine de d\u00e9cembre. Sa diffusion est organis\u00e9e par les m\u00e9dias fran\u00e7ais comme France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions, qui retransmet durant 30 heures une \u00e9mission de marathon tout en regroupant des patients, des scientifiques, des b\u00e9n\u00e9voles ainsi que des artistes\u00a0; tous veulent participer \u00e0 cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement pour la bonne cause. En 2018, la valeur des dons faits par les Fran\u00e7ais et destin\u00e9s \u00e0 lutter contre les maladies neuromusculaires et g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques s'\u00e9levait \u00e0 pr\u00e8s de 86 millions d'euros. Les missions sociales d'AFM-T\u00e9l\u00e9thon en 2018 En 2018, la somme d\u00e9pens\u00e9e par l'Association pour les missions sociales \u00e9tait de pr\u00e8s de 91 millions d'euros. Sur la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode, 54 millions d'euros ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s pour aider \u00e0 financer la recherche de moyens pour gu\u00e9rir les maladies neuromusculaires et g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques. Le but \u00e9tait d'investir dans des th\u00e9rapies innovantes, la pharmacologie et la recherche et le d\u00e9veloppement (R&D). En outre, 34,7 millions d'euros ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 disposition afin d'aider les personnes concern\u00e9es, par exemple, \u00e0 l'accession au diagnostic et au traitement des patients et leurs familles. La charit\u00e9 en France En 2017, le montant des dons effectu\u00e9s par les Fran\u00e7ais s'\u00e9levait \u00e0 2,5 milliards d'euros. Selon une enqu\u00eate men\u00e9e par Odoxa en 2018, environ 8 % des Fran\u00e7ais interrog\u00e9s ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 faire des dons mensuellement \u00e0 des associations ou des fondations, alors que plus d'un quart des Fran\u00e7ais (26\u00a0%) ont fait un seul don au cours de l'ann\u00e9e 2018. Cette statistique repr\u00e9sente le classement des dix joueurs d'e-sport ayant engendr\u00e9 le plus de revenus dans le monde au 26 novembre 2019. Le danois Johan Sundstein, dit N0tail, est arriv\u00e9 en premi\u00e8re position du classement, avec pr\u00e8s de sept millions de dollars engendr\u00e9s au fil de sa carri\u00e8re. \u00c0 titre de comparaison, la canadienne Sasha Hostyn (Scarlett) est arriv\u00e9e en t\u00eate du classement des joueuses avec pr\u00e8s de 350.000 dollars la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e. L'e-sport en France En 2018, pr\u00e8s d'un quart des consommateurs d'e-sport fran\u00e7ais avaient entre 15 et 24 ans, et environ 28\u00a0% de ceux-ci \u00e9taient des femmes. De m\u00eame, plus de 50\u00a0% des joueurs fran\u00e7ais de cette discipline suivaient des comp\u00e9titions du type ar\u00e8nes de bataille et sport. En ce qui concerne le chiffre d'affaires du secteur en France, celui-ci s'\u00e9levait \u00e0 pr\u00e8s de 29 millions de dollars sur la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode. En novembre 2019, la France comptait plus de 900 joueurs de comp\u00e9tition d'e-sport recens\u00e9s. Cette statistique repr\u00e9sente les pr\u00e9visions sur la valeur des transactions dans la technologie financi\u00e8re (Fintech) en France entre 2017 et 2023, selon le segment. Ainsi, on observe que selon l'\u00e9tude men\u00e9e par Statista Digital Market Outlook, le montant transactionnel de tous les segments de la Fintech en France devrait augmenter dans les ann\u00e9es prochaines. La Fintech de nos jours Un fait indiscutable, c'est que l'ann\u00e9e 2018 a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s positive pour le secteur \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle mondiale par rapport aux ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes. Particuli\u00e8rement pour le p\u00f4le RH et paie qui repr\u00e9sentait au deuxi\u00e8me trimestre 2019 pr\u00e8s de 40\u00a0% de la valeur totale des actions des entreprises Fintech dans le monde. Les pr\u00e9visions d'investissements dans la Fintech Les pr\u00e9visions d'investissements dans le secteur pour 2019 s'\u00e9levaient \u00e0 43 milliards de dollars, face aux 37,8 atteints au deuxi\u00e8me trimestre, ce qui se traduit comme un bon signe pour le d\u00e9veloppement de la Fintech. La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 leader du secteur La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 am\u00e9ricaine PayPal se pla\u00e7ait \u00e0 la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode en t\u00eate des entreprises de la technologie financi\u00e8re \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle mondiale, avec une capitalisation boursi\u00e8re de pr\u00e8s de 130 milliards de dollars. L'\u00e9tude men\u00e9e par BVA sur les Fran\u00e7ais et les vacances vertes r\u00e9v\u00e8le notamment la part des Fran\u00e7ais pour qui l'empreinte \u00e9cologique joue un r\u00f4le dans le choix des transports pendant leurs vacances en 2019. Cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0, 60 % des personnes interrog\u00e9es prenaient en consid\u00e9ration l'empreinte \u00e9cologique lorsqu'ils devaient choisir un mode de transport pour leurs vacances. Tandis que 12 % d'entre eux ne le prenaient pas du tout en compte. Une conscience \u00e9cologique plus m\u00fbre Papiers laiss\u00e9s par terre, m\u00e9gots sur la plage, sur-consommation d'eau dans les h\u00f4tels et sur-production de d\u00e9chets....les touristes sont loin d'\u00eatre des \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00ab\u00a0\u00e9colos\u00a0\u00bb mod\u00e8les. Cependant, les nombreuses sonnettes d'alarme, lanc\u00e9es ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es sur la gravit\u00e9 de la situation \u00e9cologique actuelle, semblent avoir peu \u00e0 peu \u00e9veill\u00e9es les consciences. Outre les d\u00e9marches mises en place par les acteurs du tourisme, les Fran\u00e7ais r\u00e9fl\u00e9chissent davantage aux choix de leur destination de vacances, aux activit\u00e9s sur place, et \u00e0 leur h\u00e9bergement. 55 % des touristes fran\u00e7ais \u00e9taient \u00e9galement soucieux dor\u00e9navant de consommer des produits locaux et de saison. Mont\u00e9e de l'\u00e9co-tourisme L'\u00e9co-tourisme est un terme qui est apparu d\u00e8s les ann\u00e9es 80 dans le but de prot\u00e9ger l'environnement tout en sensibilisant les voyageurs au cadre naturel ou aux lieux qu'ils visitent et au respect de la culture et des communaut\u00e9s locales. Cette forme de tourisme est devenue attractive en proposant notamment des h\u00e9bergements alternatifs comme la yourte ou la cabane perch\u00e9e en haut d'un arbre en pleine nature. 55 % des Fran\u00e7ais se voyaient bien y aller en couple, et 70 % le temps d'un weekend. Au cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, il y a eu un recul de 4,7\u00a0% de l'usage de la voiture en \u00cele-de-France, selon une enqu\u00eate men\u00e9e par \u00cele-de-France Mobilit\u00e9s et l'Observatoire de la mobilit\u00e9 en \u00cele-de-France (OMNIL). Le nombre total de d\u00e9placements en voiture dans un jour de la semaine, du lundi au vendredi, s'\u00e9levait en 2018 \u00e0 14,8 millions, ceux dans la petite couronne \u00e9tant les plus nombreux, avec environ 8,5 millions de d\u00e9placements quotidiennement. Les d\u00e9placements en France73 % des Franciliens poss\u00e9daient une voiture ou un autre v\u00e9hicule motoris\u00e9 en 2017, cependant seulement 26 % des Fran\u00e7ais utilisaient leur voiture tous les jours comme conducteurs en 2018, tandis que 13 % de la population fran\u00e7aise effectuaient leurs d\u00e9placements en autobus sur la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode. Les d\u00e9placements des personnes \u00e0 mobilit\u00e9 r\u00e9duite \u00e0 Paris Bien que neuf stations de m\u00e9tro \u00e9taient accessibles aux personnes \u00e0 mobilit\u00e9 r\u00e9duite (PMR) \u00e0 Paris en 2017 et que ce nombre soit rest\u00e9 le m\u00eame au cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, les autres moyens de transport en commun ont augment\u00e9 le nombre d'arr\u00eats et de gares adapt\u00e9s aux personnes souffrant d'un handicap. Mais le transport collectif qui a vraiment agi pour offrir aux PMR une meilleure mobilit\u00e9 dans la Ville des Lumi\u00e8res est le bus\u00a0: de 60 arr\u00eats de bus accessibles aux PMR en 2007, on est pass\u00e9 \u00e0 plus de 430 en 2017.

Challenges faced by the industry include rising manufacturing costs in regions like China, climbing fuel costs and weak consumer confidence throughout the economic recession. Recent phenomena in the industry include a trend towards environmentally friendly goods to appeal greater consumer awareness concerning respect for the environment, and product innovation to appeal to specific demographics such as baby boomers. The market is expected to continue recording growth according to economic recovery, which boosts consumer demand and the need for office services and supplies. Multinational companies operating in the market are likely to continue moving production to emerging nations to cut costs. A two-tiered approach may be taken by many major manufacturers based on the countries in which their consumers are situated. They may offer more technologically advanced products to consumers within areas such as North America and the EU and then produce products that are less advanced in nature but cheaper to appeal to lower income consumers in emerging nations.

We offer customized research & analysis services. Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores This page provides statistics, facts and market data related to business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce. This includes information on B2C e-commerce volume and value, as well as individual sector B2C e-commerce figures, consumer buying habits, and region-, country-, or company-specific B2C e-commerce numbers. Global B2C e-commerce sales reached 1.2 trillion dollars in 2013, of which 29.7 percent were generated by the United States. The US share of global e-commerce has been slowly but steadily decreasing, whereas China\u2019s share has skyrocketed, nearly tripling between 2010 and 2012, demonstrating the broader economic trend of power shifting away from the United States. As a result of the spread of the internet and digital payments, the number of digital buyers is also growing and was expected to increase to over 1 billion people by the end of 2013, nearly one-seventh of the world\u2019s population. Online shopping provides around ten percent of the US retail revenue, and, according to recent statistics, approximately 22 percent of all of the disposable income worldwide was spent online. Although B2C e-commerce is often used synonymously with online shopping or online retail, it also spans growing categories such as paid online services or paid content. Amazon, one of the world\u2019s largest online retailers with about 237 million customer accounts as of the end of 2014, has branched into both services (with its cloud computing and storage) and paid content (such as its app store and digital media), making it a formidable force in e-commerce. Amazon also provides third-party sellers with a platform through which other businesses and individuals can reach customers. Other B2C services include travel services, online payment providers such as PayPal, as well as the staggeringly popular online deal sites such as Groupon and LivingSocial. Paid content, such as digital video, music, and books, has exploded in recent years with the growth of companies like Netflix, Spotify, iTunes, and various app stores. The digitization of newspapers and the success of e-readers are also integral factors to the prosperity and growth of paid content e-commerce.

We provide statistics on usage, equipment sales, revenue, operator market share, consumer satisfaction and more. We also offer a range of forecasts and industry growth statistics. The telecommunications industry has seen momentous growth over the past century. The opportunity for communication around the globe has been enabled to a level never seen before. Today, there are a number of multi-national telecommunications companies that stand among the giants of the corporate world, pulling in billion dollar revenue figures and casting shadows on the economies of even the most powerful states. The leading brands include AT&T, China Mobile, Verizon, Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom, all of which enjoying valuations well into the multi-billion dollar range. It was in the 1980s that mobile phones were first released onto the market for private buyers. Today, after just a short time span, billions of individuals around the world carry mobile phones in their own pockets, and penetration rates are expected to continue increasing steadily into the future. Considering the extensive adoption rate around the globe, this industry is currently dominated by a relatively small number of suppliers. The leading device manufacturers are none other than Apple and Samsung, while the leaders with regards to smartphone operating systems are Google, with the Android system and Apple\u2019s iOS, with a combined market share of more than 90 percent on record. As a whole, the telecommunications industry generates upwards of 1 trillion euro (1.4 trillion U.S. dollars) in service revenues each year. While in the past revenue was essentially sourced from traditional landline and wireless services, today the range of products and services available in this industry is persistently increasing, offering further opportunities for revenue creation. The telecommunications industry is certainly an exciting industry to watch as it provides us with new opportunities and capabilities that were previously unimaginable as little as decades ago.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores Despite the current global economic downturn, the global apparel industry continues to grow at a healthy rate and this, coupled with the absence of switching costs for consumers and great product differentiation, means that rivalry within the industry is no more than moderate. The apparel industry is of great importance to the economy in terms of trade, employment, investment and revenue all over the world. This particular industry has short product life cycles, vast product differentiation and is characterized by great pace of demand change coupled with rather long and inflexible supply processes. Clothing is essential to consumers who are individuals. Where brand loyalty exists, it is more likely to be to the designer than the retailer, although this is usually towards the top end of the industry. There is a growing demand for discount apparel with stores such providing low cost prolific-output fashion. Fashion, by its very nature, is unpredictable. The products are determined by designers, sub-cultures and creative industries and are subject to sharp and unpredictable changes. Key suppliers in this industry are clothing manufacturers and wholesalers, with retailers able to source from both. Footwear sales have been falling in developed countries and slowing in emerging countries due to lower income levels; and therefore, less spending on apparel and footwear. Consumers are focusing increasingly on value for money, looking for simple, hard-wearing shoes that last. Designer shoes have borne the brunt of this shift in consumption brought on by the economic recession. Shoe manufacturers and retailers are since forced to compete on price and value.

Demographics are the statistical study of human population. Demographic data typically includes population size, population density and characteristics that describe the composition of the population. The population of the United States is currently slightly above 312 million people. The U.S. Census Bureau predicts further population growth in the next decades and expects the total population to reach 439 millions in 2050. The age structure of the U.S. population has been stable for the past ten years and currently looks as follows: 20 percent of the population is 65 or older, 13 percent is younger than 15 and the 67 percent is aged between 15 and 64. The median age in the United States is 36.9 years, which is relatively low compared to other developed countries. The Life expectancy in the U.S. has been rising continuously for decades. It is almost 79 years for Americans born in 2009. The population of the United States is ethnically diverse due to the country\u2019s history as an immigration country. In 2009, the ethnic composition of the U.S. population looked as follows: With 244.3 millions, the majority of the American population is white. 39.64 million Americans are black or African American; 14.01 millions are Asian; 3.15 millions are American Indian or Alaska Natives; 0.58 millions are Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanders and 5.32 million Americans reported two or more races. The 48.42 million people of Hispanic descent in the United States are included in the aforementioned numbers, because Hispanic heritage is reported separate from race by the U.S. Census Bureau.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores In this section, Statista presents the most relevant and up-to-date facts relating to the water and wastewater industries. Just like fresh air, potable water is an essential natural resource for humans and animals. Although about 70 percent of the earth\u2019s surface is covered with water, less than one percent of the planet\u2019s total water resources can be classified as accessible freshwater resources. Therefore, water is one of the scarcest and most valuable resources in many regions worldwide, and water shortages are expected to be further exacerbated by weather-related catastrophes, pollution levels and increased water consumption in populous countries such as China and India. In emerging countries, the bulk of water infrastructure spending goes to filtration and desalination projects, while developed countries are anxious to invest in their water supply networks as these continue to age. Furthermore, in order to detect leaks, meter water usage and make water delivery more efficient, the implementation of an advanced metering infrastructure seems irremissible. United Water, Suez Environnement, Veolia, Hera, American Water and SABESP (Companhia de Saneamento Basico) are the leading companies in treating wastewater and providing the public with clean water. Itron is one of the major players worldwide in the field of metering and managing water consumption.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores Fossil fuels are the cornerstone of our industrialized modern world. Some 80 percent of the global energy supply still comes from fossil fuel resources \u2013 crude oil, natural gas, and coal. Fossil fuels originated from dead plants and animals in geologic prehistory. In fact, these decomposed products saved the solar energy during that process in a way that it could be exploited and utilized. As distinct from fossil fuels, biomass consists of contemporary organic waste and rests. Fossil fuels, on the other hand, are a main cause for some of the world\u2019s urgent problems \u2013 climate change and global warming. The technical exploitation of fossil fuels in the 18th and 19th century was a crucial requirement for the industrial revolution. Some of today\u2019s largest companies trace their roots back to those times. Texas-based oil and gas giant ExxonMobil, is a direct descendant of legendary John D. Rockefeller\u2019s Standard Oil company, founded in 1870. The same is true for top U.S. coal mining companies like Peabody Energy and Consol Energy, which were founded in the 1880s and 1860s, respectively. Financial key figures of the industry\u2019s leading companies are among the top fossil fuel statistics. Production figures of oil, gas and coal are also very prominent, distributed by region or ranked by country. Reserves of fossil fuels play a vital role for the whole global economy. They are also a driver for the determination of fossil fuel prices. In this context, newly discovered deposits of oil sands and shale gas are becoming more and more important for North America.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores The Republic of Ireland is a sovereign state, located to the northwest of continental Europe. It covers just under five-sixths of the island of Ireland, sharing a border with Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom. The country is a constitutional republic with a parliamentary system of government. According to the 2011 census, the population of the Republic of Ireland is approximately 4.5 million. Gaining independence from the United Kingdom in 1922 before becoming a full republic in 1949, the Irish Republic remained one of Europe\u2019s most impoverished states for decades. Things began to improve after the country joined the European Community in 1973 while a policy of economic liberalism during the 1980s led to extensive growth. In 2002, the Republic of Ireland introduced the euro currency, along with 11 other European Union members. A period of tremendous growth and expansion took place from the mid-1990s until 2007, known universally as The Celtic Tiger. A well educated workforce, English-language business environment and a low income tax rate enticed many multinational corporations to the country. Dell, Intel, Microsoft, Google and Facebook have all invested heavily in the Irish Republic. The rapid growth during the Celtic Tiger period slowed considerably in 2007, in line with the global financial crisis. The growth was characterized by a property bubble which burst, leading to a devastating collapse on the housing market. The dependence of the economy on the construction sector coupled with a serious banking crisis led to the Republic of Ireland entering recession in 2008 before receiving 85 billion euros of assistance from the European Union and International Monetary Fund. Ireland\u2019s national debt rose in line with the economic slowdown and statistics show that is is currently standing at 180 billion euros. Based on statistics about U.S. imports from Ireland, forecasts suggest that the Irish economy may grow by 2.2 percent in 2012. An extensive agricultural sector coupled with a modern, knowledge based workforce should further aid the country\u2019s economic recovery. Statistics show that after plummeting substantially in 2010, Ireland\u2019s budget balance is showing some signs of stabilization. For such a small country, the Republic of Ireland enjoys very strong influence on the worldwide stage due to a large diaspora, especially in the United States. The Republic of Ireland has a long standing policy of neutrality, has been a member of the United Nations since 1960 and is an active member of NATO\u2019s Partnership for Peace program.

Wholesale distributors sell or orchestrate sale or purchase of goods between wholesalers or the sale of goods by wholesalers to retailers, and non-consumer goods in the form of material used in production. Other industry actors include logistics, warehousing and transportation organizations. The wholesaling industry thrives due to manufacturers or customers superior supply chain functions performance compared with that of manufacturers or customers. Wholesaler-distributors facilitate service consistency, the meeting of customer demands and are necessary for local presence and flexibility. Wholesale distribution represents the largest channel to market for manufacturers and the most valuable supply chain for customers, especially in the case of multiple smaller customers and an array of manufacturers. Merchant wholesalers are the leading type of wholesale firm, and represent the main distribution channel for most goods apart from motor vehicles and parts. Merchant wholesalers, who take ownership of products prior to distribution, are divided into subcategories, including importer and exporters, co-operative buying associations, industrial distributors, and farm products marketing cooperatives. Other merchant wholesaler types include voluntary group wholesalers, assemblers, industrial distributors, terminal elevators, retailer cooperative warehouses, cash-and-carry wholesalers and drop shippers. Technology plays a central role in the wholesale-distribution sector, particularly with regard to limiting low value-added labor activities, including inventory control, warehouse management, billing and delivery-route scheduling. Hardware technology development is equally important to the industry, and sensor technology is expected to pave the way in affording better localization visibility of goods and equipment.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores The world of computing and computer hardware is a fast and ever-evolving market. The latest trends released seemingly just the other day may be outdated and obsolete after only a few years as the market continues to leap frog off the latest advancements and inventions, continually developing new products and models. According to Statista's IT Market Model, the global IT equipment market, which includes PCs and tablets, servers, and IT peripherals, had a size of 431 billion dollars in 2017. At the top of the tech food chain are big name brands such as: Apple, IBM, Microsoft and Samsung, just to name a few, each of which generate generous profit margins thus allowing them to invest liberally in research & development programs that help them to maintain their lead in the market. Many of the leading companies in the technology field are also amongst the largest and richest companies the world overall. Just some of the more recent trends that are anticipated to see continued growth in the future are tablets, 3D printers and wearable computing devices such as smartwatches and Google Glasses. Sales of traditional PCs and laptops have been on a gradual decline as the market becomes saturated. The same goes for the relative newcomer to the market, tablets, whose sales have also been on a downward course after peaking at 230.1 million units in 2014. The 3D printing market, also known as additive manufacturing, is expected to develop into a multi-billion dollar industry as more and more uses for this technology are discovered and as technology becomes even further intertwined in our everyday lives, the transition to wearable devices can be expected in the not so distant future. Also belonging to the computing and hardware market is the IT peripherals market, which includes devices like PC monitors and projectors, keyboards, printers and storage units (USB sticks). The Statista IT Market Model estimated the global IT peripherals market to be 127 billion U.S. dollars in size in 2017. Printers, scanners and multi-purpose devices such as multi-function printers are the largest sub-segment of the IT peripherals market, with a forecasted value of 55 billion U.S. dollars by 2021.

This includes information on B2B e-commerce volume and value, as well as individual sector B2B e-commerce figures, cross-sector acquisitions and communication, and country-specific B2B e-commerce numbers. B2B e-commerce describes the electronic commerce between businesses at the level of manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers as opposed to between companies and the general public or governments. A company\u2019s finished product is often the result of multiple B2B transactions that help create a supply chain and furnish it with the goods and materials needed to manufacture that product. The acquisition and transport of supplies invariably requires shipping, the e-commerce value of which has more than doubled in almost every sector in the United States since 2003, and, according to recent statistics, e-commerce transactions in manufacturing shipments have also grown to embody almost half of the value of all manufacturing shipments. The e-commerce value of wholesale trade, an intermediate step in product distribution, is also a major theme in B2B e-commerce. E-commerce made up roughly 18 percent of the entire merchant wholesale trade sales in 2011, with a value of over 1.5 trillion U.S. dollars. Current market data is often divided up by sector and details the e-commerce value of wholesale trade of industries such as motor vehicles and automotive equipment or furniture, among others. Transactions between businesses is not limited to retail and the preparation for the sale of products. B2B e-commerce also includes the buying and selling of companies, such as photo-sharing websites or other online domains. Communication and marketing between businesses are also important for the success of this sector, and businesses even utilize social media platforms to help form and maintain relations with other businesses.

Financial institutions are establishments that provide financial services to their members and clients. They place their focus primarily on dealing with the execution of financial transactions, predominantly investments, deposits and loans. Just about everyone has to deal with a financial institution at some point, and the majority do on a regular basis. In the conventional sense, financial institutions are made up of organizations such as banks, trusts , insurance companies and investment dealers \u2013 these various entities fulfil the main role of a financial institution- acting as financial intermediaries. A financial intermediary typically fulfils its function insofar as it indirectly facilitates the channelling of funds between the lender and the borrower. The depositary institutions, one of the three major types of financial institution broadly speaking, are the deposit takers. They accept and manage deposits and make loans. Building societies, trust companies, banks and credit unions typically come under this category of financial institution. Contractual institutions deal with insurance companies and pension funds and are also counted among a major branch of financial institutions; the final being investment institutions, which include brokerage enterprises, investment banks and underwriters.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores In recent years the global toys and games industry has been influenced by changing consumer tastes, with children opting for more sophisticated video games and electronic toys. Children are becoming increasingly accustomed to changing toys more frequently. This means toy and game manufacturers must introduce new products on a regular basis, and focus on innovation and technological advancements. Market growth is being fuelled by video, console and computer games, with the industry also benefiting from a growing adult consumer base as this group takes a greater interest in games as a popular leisure pursuit. Industry players are focusing their marketing efforts on older children and adults, with small children no longer considered the industry\u2019s main target demographic. While traditional toys and games are losing some degree of popularity in the face of competition from interactive and intelligent toys, this market segment is expected to record demand in some regions.

We offer customized research & analysis services. Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores In this section, statistics and market figures relating to the consumer goods industry are presented. Consumer goods are goods which are intended for everyday private consumption. They cover a large product portfolio including food and non-food categories in order to meet consumer demand. They are further classified in fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) and slow moving consumer goods (SMCG). The definitions are based on how fast products are sold to the customer, a determining factor in the rotation of goods. FMCG are goods with a useful life shorter than a year and include product categories such as food and beverages, personal care, household and cleaning products, apparel and footwear, tobacco and pet food/pet care which are products bought relatively frequently with recurring expenditure. SMCG are goods with a useful life longer than a year comprising items such as household appliances, furniture and home improvement products. These items have a lower sales frequency and are not rotating as rapidly as FMCG. The competitive landscape of the consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry is shaped by global leading CPG companies such as US-based Procter & Gamble (P&G), Unilever, L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Nestl\u00e9. Many companies invest large amounts of money for the development of new products in accordance with recent market trends and the latest research findings. As many manufacturers operate globally, product packaging and labeling regulations have to be fulfilled in order to meet the country-specific requirements. In addition, product formulas may have to be adapted to suit different consumer tastes.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores This page provides statistics, facts and market data related to internet. This includes information on segments and industries such as social media, online search, user-generated content, online advertising and marketing as well as statistics on demographics and use. Current internet user figures suggest that there are more than 2.5 billion users worldwide with a global penetration rate of 35 percent with North America accounting for 14 percent of global internet users. Since the late 1990s, the internet has not only provided users with online experiences such as email, online search and general browsing but has also played a major role in enabling human interaction and reshaping traditional communications media such as film, television, music and telephone. The mainstreaming of internet features, such as digital music and video, user-generated content and digital media sales, have caused traditional media consumption to undergo significant changes. With the large-scale offerings of user-generated as well as licensed content in the forms of audio, video, games and writings, companies such as YouTube, Netflix, Spotify, Pandora and Tumblr have broadened the selection of available entertainment and enabled internet users to interact more closely with the media and each other. The emergences of new digital technologies and websites have accelerated forms of human interaction through online forums, instant messaging, and social networking (since the mid-2000\u2019s). Email has been a staple of the online experience. However, the rise of social networks, most notably market leader Facebook, and mobile social apps such as Twitter, LINE or WhatsApp have changed the notion of online communications and the divide of the personal and public online space. Facebook has more than 1.2 billion monthly active users, presenting a global reach of almost 50 percent of internet users worldwide. According to internet market data, online sales via B2B and B2C e-commerce have not only expanded the reach and volume of traditional wholesale and retail trade but have also changed entire business infrastructures across various industries. The reach of online commerce has also enabled small and independent business owners to pursue their business ventures across local borders. Market data suggests a steady growth of global digital buyer penetration. Online shopping is not the only way of making money via the internet \u2013 statistics suggest a growth of digital content sales via e-commerce platforms such as iTunes, Google Play or Steam as well as the vast market of online advertising and marketing. Global companies such as Google, Amazon and Baidu generate the majority of their revenues via online services. Whereas the majority of internet access used to be via a fixed-line connection to a desktop PC, the growth of mobile technologies such as WiFi and laptops as well as mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers have completely changed the online landscape. In countries with weak technological infrastructures, mobile internet has enabled people to access the web and to participate in the global information exchange. Notable examples are mobile banking and the ability to provide people with a global platform in order to broadcast their issues during times of unrest and crisis such as the Arab Spring movement. During national and global disasters such as Hurricane Sandy, Fukushima or Typhoon Yolanda, online services such as Google and Twitter have formed crisis response portals in order to co-ordinate and support rescue efforts. Today, surveys indicate that daily internet usage plays a significant role in the everyday lives of consumers in the connected world.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores Media usage, also called media consumption or media diet, is defined as \u201cthe sum of information and entertainment media taken in by an individual or group\u201d (source: Wikipedia). On Statista, users can find statistics presenting data on various aspects of media usage. Penetration rates are the most basic measure of media usage. Media penetration, or reach, indicates the share of individuals in a country, region, or group that use a medium. Once penetration has been established, media usage is measured by the time individuals spend with a medium within a certain period, e.g. daily or monthly. Consumption patterns can be studied in more detail, analyzing locations where media is consumed and devices used for its consumption (as in the case of audio, audio-visual, as well as digital media). Additional factors can also be considered. The language of media consumption is an important indicator for the analysis of multilingual territories and behavior of ethnic minorities. Media exposure, meanwhile, measures reach or penetration of media regardless of the users intent to consume\u2014the share of individuals in the vicinity of an audio or audio-visual medium that hear or see its content, with or without wishing to be exposed. In this section, Statista users will also find data on news consumption. Statista provides data on the most basic measure of news consumption\u2014how many or what share of individuals stay informed of current events\u2014as well as data on media channels used to consume news of various types (domestic news, international, sports and celebrity news). Figures on news media credibility and the popularity of news anchors are also provided here.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores Greece is a country in South-eastern Europe bordering Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria and Turkey. It is a unitary parliamentary republic and traces its lineage back to Ancient Greece, the birthplace of Western philosophy, democracy and the Olympic Games. The country has recorded a slight population growth every year over the past decade. According to statistics, the population of Greece will reach 11.21 million in 2013. As a result of its diverse topography, population density stands at approximately 87.81 inhabitants per square kilometre. Extremely mountainous terrain gives way to the Aegean, Ionian and Mediterranean Seas, where 1,400 islands draw tourists from all over the world. In fact, tourism is vitally important to Greece and makes up a large portion of the country\u2019s service sector. In 2011, Greece recorded 40 billion U.S. dollars worth of service exports. The economy is classed as advanced and high-income. It grew rapidly after the country joined the European Union in 1981, reaching its zenith in 2008 when GDP per capita was an estimated 30,779 U.S. dollars. Since 2009 however, the Greek economy has experienced an unparalleled debt crisis. GDP has fallen sharply to 21,038 U.S. dollars, while unemployment has skyrocketed. In 2013, Greece will have an unemployment rate of 25.37 percent. In order to avoid a catastrophic default, other euro area nations agreed on a fiscal rescue package, along with the International Monetary Fund worth some 45 billion euros. This proved insufficient however, and by 2012, a second bailout worth 130 billion euros was approved. This was subject to strict conditions and fiscal reform involving a public sector cull and harsh austerity measures. Germany has provided the bulk of funding to the European Stability Mechanism which implemented the rescue package. Anti-German sentiment has been rising in Greece as a result, where immense dissatisfaction has led to street clashes and protests. Greece is a founding member of the United Nations and joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in 1952. The country became a member of the European Union in 1981. Despite the debt crisis, Greece has continued to record strong export figures. At the same time however, national debt has risen continuously. By 2013, Greek national debt will reach 346 billion U.S. dollars. Show more Feel free to contact us anytime using our contact form or visit our FAQ page.

The rises in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are believed to be the result of the earth\u2019s industrialization, which began in the late 1700s. Currently, China is the largest producer of CO2 emissions. In 1992, the United Nations introduced the Conference on Climate Change in order to tackle carbon dioxide emissions and climate change. Some five years later, the intergovernmental organization signed the Kyoto Protocol, an environmental treaty with the goal of protecting the earth\u2019s climate system from \u201cdangerous\u201d anthropogenic interference. In accordance with the treaty, several countries have initiated a number of measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These measures include the introduction of a price for carbon, a reduction of livestock, reforestation and a decreased use of fossil fuels in energy generation. In order to save energy-related emissions, big greenhouse gas producers such as the United States, China, India and Brazil have started to add renewable sources to the energy mix. In a recent agreement, the U.S. pledged to cut carbon dioxide emissions to between 26 and 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores In this section, Statista presents the most relevant and up-to-date facts relating to the heavy and civil engineering construction industry. This industry performs activities on heavy and civil engineering construction projects. Typically, these activities are not performed on buildings, but are rather inclined to focus on infrastructure-related projects. The sector can be broken down into the following segments: water and sewer, conservation and development, as well as power, communication and transportation infrastructure construction. More often than not, the implementation of heavy and civil engineering construction projects goes hand in hand with political decision-making, and government expenditure is an important driver of growth for the industry. As a result, the sector is in somewhat of a downturn caused by cuts in government spending in many countries. Over the next couple of years, public-private partnerships are projected to play an important role in the heavy and civil engineering construction industry, both in emerging and developed markets. Currently, being active in the Chinese market is the key to success for infrastructure construction companies. Heavy and civil engineering construction projects are often designed, financed and supervised by general contractors. The world\u2019s leading construction companies include Bechtel, Spain\u2019s ACS Group, France\u2019s Vinci, Germany\u2019s Hochtief and China\u2019s CRCC (China Railway Construction Corporation).

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores The United States of America is the largest country in the Americas by land area and the fourth largest country in the world. The cultural and political influence it exerts globally, backed up by its status as the world most militarily powerful country, has enabled it to retain its status as the unchallenged global force. A federal constitutional republic, it consists of fifty states and one federal capital district \u2013 Washington D.C. Statistics relating to the United States convey a plethora of impressive facts and figures that support this country\u2019s economic, political, industrial and cultural development. Every year, the United States attracts swathes of overseas visitors to the Great Plains, shining seas and urban metropolises. Here you will find information relating the most current and exciting market data and statistics on the USA. Population numbers in the USA have grown steadily in the last decade, caused in no small part by the migration flow into the country. Statistical data about the ten largest migration flows between countries in 2010, compiled by the World Bank, puts Mexico-USA in first place. In that year, 11.6 million migrants made their way to the USA from Mexico. Mexico significantly outstripped China, with 1.7 million Chinese migrants arriving in the country in 2010. This is sometimes problematic, as illegal immigration is rife in some areas, which poses a number of challenges to U.S. authorities. In 2009, Mexico also managed to top the USA\u2019s list of the highest number of illegal immigrants by country of origin, which according to the U.S Department of Homeland Security, currently sits at around six million. The United States is often taken as a prime example of a cultural melting pot due to the vast array of migrants who have played such an important role in its history and development. According to the International Monetary Fund, the total population of the US totaled around 312 million people in 2011, and although the rate of population growth in the US has sunk somewhat since 2007 - from 1 percent to 0.66 percent - the country remains one of the most populated in the world (behind India and China). The USA economy is the largest and most developed in the world and has remained largely unchallenged in this role for decades. However, its long-term position has begun to appear less stable in recent years, as China pursues its rapid economic policies of development. In 2011, according to data from the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. GDP reached over 15 trillion U.S. dollars, according to the International Monetary Fund. The unemployment rate in the US in 2011 was at around nine percent, less than the previous year, while the size of the labor force in the US amounted to almost 140 million people. The United States economy is still suffering the backlash of the 2008 financial crisis, which had its roots in the subprime mortgage market, leaving a global crisis in its wake. The quarterly growth rate of the GDP in the US was three percent in the fourth quarter of 2011. A 2010 WTO ranking of the largest exporting countries listed the USA as the second-largest merchandise exporter worldwide.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores The pharmaceutical industry is responsible for the development, production and marketing of medications. Thus, its immense importance as a global sector is evident. The total level of pharmaceutical revenue worldwide had reached nearly one trillion U.S. dollars. Branded, patented medicines by far make up the largest share of pharmaceutical revenues. On the other hand, generics are of substantial importance for the availability of medicines to large parts of the population. Based on prescription sales, NYC-based Pfizer is the world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical company. In 2012, the company generated some 47 billion U.S. dollars in pure pharmaceutical sales, while total revenue stood at nearly 60 billion U.S. dollars. Other top global players from the United States are Johnson & Johnson, Merck and Abbott. Novartis and Roche from Switzerland, GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca from the United Kingdom, and French Sanofi are the European big five. Oncologics continue to generate the largest amount of revenue among all therapeutic classes. In 2012, more than 60 billion U.S. dollars of revenue were made globally by cancer drugs. Other best-selling therapeutic classes for the pharmaceutical industry were pain drugs, antihypertensives and antidiabetics. More than any other industry, the pharmaceutical sector is highly dependent on its research and development segment. The top pharmaceutical companies invest up to 20 percent of their revenues in R&D measures. The United States is a traditional stronghold of pharmaceutical innovation.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores On this page you can find statistics, facts, market data and other information about the accommodation industry including hotels, apartment rentals, extended stay accommodation, bed & breakfast and more. Hotels make up a fundamental part of the accommodation industry. This segment can be divided into two broad categories \u2013 independent / unaffiliated hotels and hotels that are part of a chain. In the United States, hotels owned or affiliated with a hotel chain make up about two thirds of the market. Amongst the major hotel companies worldwide are the International Hotels Group, Marriott International, Hilton Worldwide, Accor, Starwood Hotels & Resorts and others. Chain hotels are often broken down into six segments \u2013 luxury, upper upscale, upscale, upper midscale, midscale and economy \u2013 to classify branded hotels. In the United States the upper midscale segment is the largest. The most important metrics, or benchmark figures, within the hotel industry are the average daily rate, the occupancy rate, and the revenue per available room. The occupancy rate denotes the percentage of hotel rooms that are rented out at a given time of all the hotel rooms that are available. The average daily rate (ADR) shows the average rate at which hotel rooms were paid. It is calculated by dividing total rooms revenue by the number of rooms that were occupied. Revenue per available room (Revpar) is a measure of utilization in the hotel industry and can be calculated by multiplying the average daily rate of a property (market) by its occupancy rate.

Plastics are defined as an organic polymeric solid state, which can be produced in a synthetic or semi-synthetic way. Raw materials for the production of plastics are usually petrochemical products. Plastic exhibits a number of interesting and extraordinary characteristics. Its hardness, flexibility, formability as well as its break resistance make it suitable for application almost anywhere. Although, such characteristics are dependent on the manufacturing method and can vary due to the usage of additives in the creation process. The total global production of plastics amounts to approximately 300 million metric tons annually. The leading producer of plastics is China, manufacturing around a quarter of the world\u2019s production. The plastics industry is an important segment of the chemical industry, largely dominated by the top global players of the branch, like LyondellBasell, Dow Chemical, DuPont, BASF, and Bayer. The rubber industry is also a subdivision of the chemical industry. Around 60 percent of the total global rubber production today is produced synthetically. With both core products being derived mainly from petrochemicals, the synthetic rubber industry and the plastics industry form a coherent subsector. Originally, rubber could be produced only from latex gained from rubber trees. Due to its characteristics, such as distensibility, resiliency, and the fact that it is waterproof, rubber became popular and frequently utilized in many industries.

Banks provide us with the financial services that make up an essential part of our every day lives. Various banking forms exist to meet the needs of individual customers, enterprises or governments. Commercial banking services are the arm of the banking sector with which the majority of people come into contact for their day to day needs; they are most commonly referred to simply as \u2018banks\u2019. Commercial banks supply their customers with, among other things, personal, commercial and mortgage loans, credit cards, debit cards and check books and investment products such as mutual funds. The term \u2018commercial bank\u2019 is used predominantly to distinguish it from an investment bank. Investment banks offer services differing considerably from those offered by a commercial bank; an investment bank offers access to capital market services, underwriting debt and equity in order to assist in company deals such as mergers and acquisitions. It also provides services to individuals in private banking services, these are however only accessible to high-net-worth individuals and many investment banks require that a minimum net worth amount is met in order to qualify for the services. Although banks make up a significant part of what we understand to be financial services, the industry also encompasses a broad range of other industries that help us to manage money. These include everything from credit card companies, to credit unions, accountancy companies to investment funds to the brokerage of stock and investment funds.

The most well known medical technology products are, among others, pacemakers, imaging instruments, dialysis machines and implants. But medical technology products and medical devices include a larger range of products. Thermometers and gloves can be defined as medical devices as well as an in-vitro reagent.

Established centers of this industry are the United States and Western Europe, both generating the largest share of the global medtech revenue. According to that, most of the top medical technology companies come from these two regions. Some are only divisions of larger companies, like global leader Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices & Diagnostics, or General Electric Healthcare. In 2012, Johnson & Johnson made some 27.4 billion U.S. dollars through its medtech division, followed by German Fresenius Group, generating 25.4 billion U.S. dollars. However, Asia and first of all China are expected to become more prominent within the global medical technology industry.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores The retail trade industry is responsible for the display and sale of new or used goods to consumers for personal or household consumption. The retail trade division includes motor vehicle retail, fuel retailing, food retailing, and other forms of store-based retail. In the past the sector has seen a rapid reduction in the number of department stores and the rise of supermarkets and shopping centers. More recently, there has been a rise of convenience shopping, online trading, and the growth of franchising. As it has grown the retail trade industry has had to remain flexible to cope with economic challenges, technological advances, consumer trends, new retail formats, globalization and increasing competition. The industry is characterized by a high degree of casual, part time and seasonal employment. It is estimated that more than half of the adult population is either currently working, or has worked at some time in their life, in the retail industry. The world retailing industry is becoming increasingly competitive, forcing companies to take an innovative approach to attract consumers and encourage long-term loyalty. Department stores, for example, are increasing consumer footfalls by replacing more expensive brand-name products with less expensive private-label products. There are many market segments that are fuelling the growth of this industry. For example, the world multi-line retail industry, specialty retail market (products encompassed in the specialty retail industry include computer and electronics, automotive retail, home furnishing retail, apparel retail and specialty stores.), the convenience store industry and the global e-commerce industry are all expected to grow significantly in the next few years especially in emerging markets such as Latin America, the Middle East and Asia. The global e-commerce industry is boosted by wider internet penetration, with about 2.5 billion people using the internet in 2012. Business to consumer e-commerce growth in the U.S. is forecast to slow over the years to come while growth in other regions will gain momentum, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, where sales are estimated to reach approximately 69 billion U.S. dollars. Key players operating in the global retail market include House of Fraser, Galeries Lafayette, Arnotts, Fenwick, Bloomingdale\u2019s, John Lewis, GALERIA Kaufhof, Arcandor, Debenhams, Saks Fifth Avenue, Macy's, Stockmann, Marks & Spencer, Beales, Sears, DWW Woolworth Germany, El Corte Ingl\u00e9s, Dillard's, Roebuck & Company, The Bay, Nordstrom and Maxeda.

The retail landscape has become extremely competitive with high pressure coming from multiple retail formats. Hard discount stores such as Aldi, for example, carry a limited assortment of products. They follow a business strategy of offering quality products at low prices. In this multichannel reality, traditional retail stores have to try staying competitive by providing a unique and personal shopping experience. Recent research showed that organic supermarkets are no longer a niche market, but attract plenty of consumer profiles ranging from exclusive organic buyers to customers purchasing organic foods once or twice a month. Texas-based Whole Foods Market was the first nationally certified organic grocer in the United States. Further rankings of the leading national retail and supermarket chains are provided. Based on the latest retail sales, the top three US retailers included Walmart, Kroger, and Costco. In addition, the category specifically covers statistics highlighting key indicators such as sales per store, the average number of checkouts or average per store selling area. More interesting figures shaping the industry include number of stores, frequency of consumer purchases, and trends in prices.

Amongst the leading companies in the industry are Disney Parks and Resorts, Universal Studios Theme Parks, the Merlin Entertainment Group, SeaWorld Entertainment, and OCT Parks China. National parks, monuments and sites in the United States are mostly under the administration of the National Park Service. Several hundred million people visit these parks, sites and monuments each year, generating an annual direct economic impact on local economies of almost 10 billion U.S. dollars. Public parks, which can mostly be found in cities, on the other hand are mostly maintained by city park agencies and not by one nationwide homogeneous organization.

It mainly includes the exploration, production and processing of natural resources which are located in the Earth\u2019s crust. Metals and minerals are essential for many other industries. For example, iron ore for making steel is essential in the construction and machinery industry. Another prominent mined commodity is coal, still one of the largest energy resources worldwide, as is uranium, the basic raw material for the generation of nuclear energy. The most valued metals are the so called precious metals. These include, first of all, gold, silver, and the platinum group. Gold and silver have always been signs of wealth, and still are important drivers in the financial world. Historic price developments of precious metals are among the top statistics of this branch. Less valued, but highly sought after, are the so called base metals. Iron, lead, nickel, zinc and copper are the best known base metals and are utilized in everyday life. Over the last few years, rare earths became a top issue in the world of mining. The group contains 17 elements, which are extremely sought after, especially by high-tech industries. Rare earth elements are mostly used for the production of magnets, catalyzers, displays, etc. For example, the wind power industry is highly dependent on these materials, as some rare forms are needed for the production of permanent magnets installed in wind turbines.

Packaging paper, graphic paper and hygienic paper are the major product groups of this industry. Although China is the world\u2019s leading country when it comes to paper and paperboard production, the international pulp and paper market is dominated by companies from North America, northern Europe and Japan. Some 400 million metric tons of paper and cardboard are produced worldwide every year, with China being responsible for around one quarter of the total production. The industry is dominated by International Paper and Kimberly-Clark from the United States, Stora Enso and UPM-Kymmene from Finland, and Oji Paper and Nippon Paper Group from Japan. It is estimated that the top 20 companies generate some 40 percent of the total global paper and paperboard production. Among the top data of the pulp and paper subcategory are rankings of these major companies. Consumption figures on global and regional level show us that paper utilization almost totally equates to the global industry\u2019s production. As paper is defined as a renewable resource, recycling is a major issue for this industry. Huge amounts of paper are collected worldwide annually, making it a significant part of this branch.

The most important classes of road vehicles include cars, commercial vehicles and two-wheelers. Although sometimes equipped with three or more wheels, motorcycles, scooters and bicycles are included in the two-wheeler category. In this segment, it is particularly the powered two-wheelers that are becoming increasingly popular, especially in urban regions. Harley-Davidson, Polaris and Piaggio are among the largest companies in this field. Commercial vehicles are often grouped into eight different types, ranging from Class 1 light duty trucks to Class 8 heavy duty haulers. The largest truck manufacturers include Daimler, Dongfeng, Tata, Volvo and Paccar. The automobile is one of the most comfortable and popular conveyances for transporting passengers. Its invention is largely credited to the German engineer Carl Benz. His Patent-Motorwagen is widely regarded as the world\u2019s first motor-powered car. Fitted with a four-stroke internal combustion engine, the vehicle was awarded a patent in 1886, some twenty years before Henry Ford\u2019s mass-manufactured Model T made its way onto the streets. Since then, the automobile has come a long way. Today, it is normal for cars to have Internet access, and a growing number of electric vehicles is connected to the power grid. Europe, China and the United States are counted among the most important automobile markets today, both in terms of production and sales. Toyota, Volkswagen and General Motors are the world\u2019s leading automakers.

In the 18th century, the introduction of James Watt\u2019s improved steam engine heralded a new era: the Industrial Revolution. More and more countries began to plan and finance an increasing number of railway tracks and stations. Rail traffic can be broken down to passenger rail travel and cargo rail transport. While commuters and tourists prefer to travel in passenger rail cars, cargo is typically transported by freight cars. The world\u2019s leading markets for cargo rail traffic include China, the United States and Russia. The United States is also home to the world\u2019s largest railroad station: Grand Central Terminal, at 42nd Street and Park Avenue in New York, has 44 platforms serving 67 tracks. However, the busiest train stations are situated in Japan \u2013 one of the most densely populated (large) countries globally. Although many approaches to privatize the industry have been initiated, the industry continues to be dominated by state-controlled incumbents. Along with China, Japan is ranked as the largest market for passenger rail traffic. The largest companies transporting freight and passengers by rail include Amtrak, Union Pacific, Deutsche Bahn, East Japan Railway and SNCF.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores This page provides statistics, facts and market data related to cyber crime. This includes information on segments such as fraud, hacking, cyber bullying and electronic harassment, cyber warfare as well as statistics on demographics. Cyber crime or computer crime can be divided into two categories: the first comprises crimes that target computers directly such as viruses, attacks and malware; the second focuses on online crime that uses computer networks or devices as means to perform fraud and identity theft through social engineering as well as cyber bullying, cyber stalking and cyber warfare. Currently, companies in the United States experience an annual loss of more than 525 million US dollars due to cyber crime with the majority of these losses stemming from malicious code and denial of service attacks. Data breaches and their consequences have also had profound effects on consumers with personal information and credit details being stolen. The biggest online data breach compromised more than 130 million user accounts. Online brands with the highest chance of being targeted by phishing attacks include online payment provider Paypal and online auction house eBay, as well as numerous online service providers that require personal identification as well as payment information. With the ubiquity of the internet, an increased online usage and the spread of social network usage throughout all age groups, cyber bullying and cyber stalking have become increasingly common, especially among teenagers. Cyber bullying is defined as the harming or harassing of other people in a deliberate, repeated, and hostile manner, including cyber dating abuse within relationships.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores In this section, Statista presents the most relevant and up-to-date facts relating to the metals and electronics industries. These industries comprise a wide range of sectors. Among others, the electronics and engineering industries include the following areas: automation, medical electrical devices, lighting, batteries, as well as the manufacture of machine tools, cars and other vehicles, rolling stock, ships and aircraft. The metals industry is an essential contributor to the transportation equipment manufacturing industry and the construction sector. In addition to that, the past decade has seen a growing use of metals in batteries and consumer electronics products, including tablets, smartphones and television sets. However, as China is ramping up production capacity for steel and aluminum, overcapacities remain a constant focus of discussion in the sector. Today, China\u2019s Hebei is the world\u2019s third-largest steel producer, while Chalco is the market leader in the aluminum industry. Regarding the electronics sector, a number of trends augur well for the industry: In light of growing climate change awareness, alternative propulsion and powertrain technologies are gaining in importance, and, as many countries have begun to phase-out incandescent light bulbs, sales of LEDs (light-emitting diodes) and OLEDs (organic light-emitting diodes) are currently experiencing a boom. Furthermore, the rise in labor costs in emerging markets has triggered shipments of service and industrial robots, particularly in Asia and Europe.

We offer customized research & analysis services. Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores Health is a term that describes a person\u2019s mental and physical condition. As a more specific definition, health is the state of being free from physical and mental injury or illness. Managing health on a national scale is one of the most heavily-debated policy issues in many countries. Setting up a functioning health system is a challenge that requires the cooperation of many parties across public and private sectors. The health system of the United States is often criticized for being overly costly and inefficient. The United States has the highest health costs per capita worldwide and still the U.S. lags behind other industrialized countries in terms of health indicators such as life expectancy, infant mortality and health insurance coverage. Health is also a large industry. For example, health service sites in the United States create some 16 million jobs. Another example is the pharmaceutical industry which generates almost one trillion U.S. dollars of revenue worldwide. That makes it one of the larger global industries. Pharmaceutical companies manufacture a large scope of medicines for humans and animals. Since the global population and life expectancy are steadily increasing, and technological progress is very fast, the pharmaceutical industry appears relatively crisis-proof. On the other hand, pharmaceutical companies are under pressure from generic manufacturers or spending cuts by national health policies. Besides the pharmaceutical sector, all other areas of health and healthcare are included in this category. Physicians and hospitals are the groundwork of every health system. Public and private health programs are responsible for availability, distribution, efficiency and affordability of health services. Care and support is an important issue, especially for disabled people and the elderly. Medical care is difficult to imagine without modern medical technology. Top statistics in the health category cover topics concerning health spending, hospital and physician infrastructure, and U.S. state rankings. There is also a wide base of information, globally and nationally, on many diseases and health conditions. This includes prevention and therapy.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores Information technology services are those services used by organizations in creating, managing, and delivering information as well as assisting with other business functions. These services include consulting, software development, systems integration, in addition to more \u201chands-on\u201d tasks such as hardware deployment and support, training and education, and hosted and outsourced IT services. According to Statista's IT Market Model, spending in the global IT services market is expected to reach 846 billion dollar mark by 2021, up from 737 billion U.S. dollars in 2017. North America is the largest regional IT services market, accounting for almost half of the global market. Leading vendors in the industry include IBM, Accenture, Microsoft, Amazon and Fujitsu, all of which generate multi-billion dollar revenue figures on a yearly basis. A vital segment of the IT services market is cloud computing. Cloud computing is essentially services or software that are offered purely online via network-based distribution channels. While the providers of cloud services do have servers, hardware and staff sitting in an actual location, the services they offer can be accessed and utilized entirely online from anywhere, without the need for users to install any software or hardware. Examples of cloud services that are extensively used around the world include Gmail/online email, Spotify and even Facebook. Statista forecasted that the global revenue from cloud computing services would boom into the next few years, reaching a total amount of 172 billion U.S. dollars by 2021. Also a major segment of the IT services industry is the IT outsourcing market, which is the use of service providers for delivering IT-reliant business processes, application services, and infrastructure solutions. Statista's IT Market Model divided the IT outsourcing industry into four sub-segments: professional payment services, IT-infrastructure outsourcing, IT-application outsourcing, and IT-administration outsourcing. The overall IT-outsourcing market had a size of 375 billion U.S. dollars in 2017 and is forecasted to reach 413 billion by 2021.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores On this page, we present statistics, facts and Statista Dossiers about the business / corporate travel industry. In general , business/corporate travel involves all travel-related arrangements such as transportation, accommodation and subsistence. Figures on numerous kinds of expenses related to conferences, travel, exhibitions and meetings can also be found in this category. Depending on the size of a company and its travel management policy, corporate travel management (CTM) is carried out by a corporate travel manager most of the time. This task is usually part of the Finance, Human Resources, Procurement or any Administrative Services Department. However, many companies decide to outsource this job , so the actual booking and sometimes even travel management is often delegated or outsourced to so-called Travel Management Companies (TMC). Amongst the largest companies in the field are Travel Solutions International (TSI), Omega World Travel, BCD Travel, Carlson Wagonlit Travel, GSM Travel, MeritBiz and others. Travel management can be a significant item of expenditure on a company\u2019s tally. Oftentimes the expenses for corporate/business travel make up a corporation\u2019s second or third largest controllable expense behind salaries and wages and IT expenditure.

The term rolling stock may refer to any kind of powered or unpowered conveyance that moves on a railway, including coaches, locomotives, railroad cars and wagons. While emerging markets have the largest potential for growth, developed countries such as Japan, Switzerland and Hong Kong are leaders when it comes to railroad infrastructure. Asia and Western Europe are the key markets for railway technology. These regions are also the most important markets for high-speed trains, which operate at a minimum speed of 186 miles per hour. Due to the fact that high-speed rail is practically non-existent in the United States, train crashes are much less likely to occur here than in Europe or Asia. China\u2019s CRRC Corporation Limited, Canada\u2019s Bombardier, and Germany\u2019s Siemens are among the leading manufacturers of railroads and locomotives. Union Pacific, Canadian National Railway and East Japan Railway are ranked among the largest railway companies worldwide.

Expenditures on hospitals and physicians are subject to frequent and heated public discussions, making them an important issue for every health system and every health policy. A physician, or doctor, is professionally engaged in prevention, diagnosis, treatment and post-treatment of diseases and injuries. The medical profession is one of the oldest in human history. Today, due to the variety of diseases and health conditions and their different treatment options, physicians are often experts in a certain specialty health area. The physicians\u2019 density \u2013 the number of doctors per a certain group of the population - is always an important indicator for the availability of healthcare in a country. The quality of medical care can be observed on the basis of low prevalence and incidence rates as well as low death rates. Hospitals are healthcare institutions, in which physicians, surgeons and nurses provide medical care - diagnosis, treatment and therapy - to patients. Hospital patients can be classified as outpatients when they do not stay overnight and as inpatients when they stay one night or longer. Hospitals are divided into \u201cnonprofit\u201d and \u201cfor profit\u201d facilities. Most hospitals are nonprofit institutions, funded by the public sector or charitable organizations. Hospitals can also be of general and specialized types. Pharmacies are the most important places for the distribution of medicines amongst patients. Pharmacists are responsible for compounding and dispensing as well as for the safe and efficient usage of pharmaceutical drugs. There are many types of pharmacies today such as community pharmacies, hospital pharmacies, ambulatory care pharmacies, clinical pharmacies, etc. For a decade and a half, internet pharmacies are demonstrating increasing popularity worldwide.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores In this section, Statista presents the most relevant and up-to-date facts relating to passenger and cargo air traffic. The aviation industry comprises passenger airlines, freight forwarders and related infrastructure such as airports and warehouses. In terms of brand value, the largest passenger airlines include Lufthansa, Emirates and Delta Air Lines. The latter is also the leading airline in terms of passenger traffic, while Emirates leads the list of cargo carriers, based on freight mileage. Ryanair and Southwest Airlines are the main players in the low-cost category, which is attracting a growing customer base. In this segment, many carriers charge for ancillary services to boost revenue. The United States, Brazil, China and the European Union are ranked among the most important markets for air travel. The busiest airports are Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport (IATA: ATL), handling over 90 million passengers annually, and Hong Kong International Airport (IATA: HKG), where about four million tons of freight is loaded and unloaded per year. Air freight chiefly refers to dangerous items, animals and mail. Although speed is the great advantage of flying, the dramatic increase in fuel prices has caused the air freight market to decline significantly, and forced forwarders to turn to sea vessels and railroads when shipping heavy cargo.

Based on the NAICS classification, establishments involved in the forestry sector include timber tract operations, forest nurseries and gathering of forest products, and logging. The forestry sector provides information on the status and trends of national forests. It analyzes how big the area of forest is, where it is located, determines the forest\u2019s ownership (publicly- or privately-owned) and reports how the forest area is changing and growing in order to monitor forest\u2019s health. On the other hand, forests serve as recreational areas and shall secure the large variety of flora and fauna. In the United States, about one third of the total area is covered by forest. Most of the forested land is privately owned (about 60 percent), whereas the public sector administers about one third only.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores The home furnishings retail industry allows consumers to make their homes truly their own with their very choices of furniture and d\u00e9cor to adorn them. Along with the struggling housing markets, so too are retailers of home furnishings and furniture. Except for huge sale events or the holiday bargains come Black Friday or Boxing Day, consumers continue to shy away from spending on furniture and home furnishings. With the signs of recovery, however, consumers are expected to begin comfortably spending again. Style, affordability and functionality are the main reasons consumers give for shopping lifestyle furniture stores, such as Ikea, Williams-Sonoma, Crate & Barrel and Restoration Hardware. Demand for home furnishings is cyclical, influenced by housing starts, as desires to remodel and redesign are not necessary during slow economic times. Demand is also driven by consumer income. Large companies compete through volume purchasing, breadth of products, and effective merchandising and marketing. Small companies focus on a market segment and compete through depth of products and superior customer service. Competition for home furnishing stores includes department stores, mass merchandisers, home improvement stores, furniture makers that have their own stores, and online and mail order retailers. Operators in this industry retail a range of home furnishing goods including furniture, upholstery, carpets, wall coverings, as well as soft home furnishings such as bedspreads and other bed-related items, linens, tablecloths, and candles. The industry also includes the housewares retail segment, covering retailing of durable household products such as cutlery, cookware, glassware, crystal, china, dinnerware, silverware, utensils, and other kitchenware items.

According to figures published by the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), the total number of international tourist arrivals worldwide has more than doubled over the past twenty years. In 1995, the UNWTO counted around 530 million arrivals. In 2012, the number or arrivals exceeded one billion for the first time. Tourism is a big part of the economy and an important driver of growth. At the same time, topics like the inclusive development and environmental sustainability are becoming more important in the industry. Many, mostly service-oriented industries benefit from tourism either directly or indirectly. Amongst those industries are airlines and other transportation services, the cruise ship industry, hospitality services, such as the accommodation industry, restaurants, resorts, and the wellness & spa industry. Entertainment venues, such as casinos, shopping malls, music venues, theatres, and amusement & theme parks are also, often at the same time, beneficiaries and drivers of tourism. Institutions, establishments and facilities like National Parks, monuments, historic sites and other recreational areas are also often amongst the things that make certain places attractive for touristic activities.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores In less than a century the software market has grown from non-existent, into a multi-billion dollar industry. According to Statista's IT Market Model Survey, revenue of the global software market amounted to 481 billion U.S. dollars. Today, software forms the basis of many modern devices, such as PCs, smartphones, tablets and navigation systems, that we have come to rely on so heavily in our everyday lives. In the future as more and more devices and appliances, such as household appliances, watches, cars and even glasses, are developed into \u201csmart\u201d devices, the software market will only continue to expand and evolve. Considering the rapid pace of development seen over the past decade, it is exciting to imagine what the software industry will be capable of in another 10 years time. Some of the biggest companies within the software industry today include Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, SAP and Salesforce, all boasting billion dollar revenue figures. At the other end of the scale, a more recent development in the software industry is the increase in freelancers working independently to create software, in particular various apps for smartphones and tablets. Programming has become far more accessible, essentially to anyone with access to a computer and the internet and with the time and will to learn. When looking at operating systems however, the various markets tend to be dominated again by large companies and very few at that. When looking at the smartphone operating systems market, the field is dominated by Google\u2019s Android system and is followed at some distance by Apple with iOS. When it comes to the tablet operating system market, Apple was able to hold out their lead much longer against Android, with these two companies again dominated the landscape. In the world of PCs however, Microsoft is of course the big name with a combined market share of over 80 percent with their various windows products. The global operating system market was measured by Statista's IT Market Model to be 35 billion U.S. dollars in size in 2018 and is forecasted to experience a slight growth to 37 billion U.S. dollars by 2021. Enterprise software, the type of software that helps businesses to accomplish their corporate goals, is also largely a playground for the big software companies. Size of the global business software market, which includes enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM) software, was estimated by Statista to be 83 billion U.S. dollars in 2018. Leading CRM vendors include Salesforce, Oracle and SAP, which also play big roles in the ERP market. Human resource management (HRM), supply chain management (SCM), business intelligence (BI) and business process management (BPM) also fall into this category.

This includes information on C2C e-commerce volume and value, as well as figures for platforms that enable C2C e-commerce.

These go-between websites earn their money mainly from small fees charged to sellersand often provide a secure and convenient payment method. Since its launch in 1995, the online auction and selling website eBay has been one of the leaders of C2C e-commerce and statistics show that it is one of the fastest-growing internet companies with its annual net revenue doubling between 2008 and 2013. Its revenue comes from a small fee charged to users who post items for sale or auction. Recent market data shows that eBay\u2019s audience stretches over most of the world and drew over 84 million US visitors in the beginning of 2014. Etsy, another intermediary platform, has developed a profitable niche for handmade and vintage goods, and many sellers who have opened accounts consider their Etsy shops as businesses rather than just a hobby.

(source: wikipedia) The category Society at Statista is a bit different from other categories because it is not directly related to an industry or a distinctive economical branch. Society contains a broader set of topics across industries, like macroeconomic indicators as the Gross Domestic Product or general employment figures for the workforce of the United States. Additionally all things relating the general population of a country (mostly the U.S.) belongs in this category, ranging from general demographics, education and religion, to politics and the state of the government. Society is organized in seven subcategories: As mentioned before there is data on demographics containing general population figures like birth and death rates, numbers on marriage and divorce, or ethnicity and age, but also data on the structure and living situation of families and households in general. The second major subcategory contains data relating the nations\u2019 economic development and situation. In here are gathered macroeconomic and microeconomic data, data on employment, earnings, income and poverty, cost of living and much more. Politics and Government is the third major subcategory presenting all data and statistics on the work and status of the government, like expenses, budget plans and the public debt. Public opinion on political issues and discussion can be found here, next to data on elections and the composition of Congress. National security and defense is also a topic here. There are four more subcategories in society regarding crime and law enforcement, education, religion and geography and environment.

Waste, more commonly known as garbage, trash or litter, can be split up into a hazardous and a non-hazardous segment. Hazardous waste can be liquids, solids, semi-solid sludges or gases that are known to exhibit one or more of the following characteristics: ignitability, reactivity, corrosivity and toxicity. While hazardous waste needs to be stored in safe tanks or containers, non-hazardous waste may be disposed of at landfills or incineration facilities. There are about 1,900 municipal waste landfills in the United States. Veolia Environnement, Waste Management and Republic Services are counted among the largest waste management companies worldwide. The trash that is produced in the residential sector is called municipal solid waste (MSW). MSW includes grass clippings, food scraps, packaging, computers and refrigerators. Many materials that end up in waste streams can be recovered for recycling. Ferrous and non-ferrous metals are among the most precious recyclable commodities. Many industries have taken to collecting scrap from waste streams, wrecked automobiles, dismantled buildings or other industrial sources. The use of recycled materials also provides environmental benefits such as energy savings and a reduced amount of materials in the municipal solid waste stream. Globally, waste recycling rates are highest in European countries, such as Austria, Germany and Belgium.

This category includes the manufacture of machine tools, material handling systems, heavy machinery, industrial machinery, as well as the manufacture of propulsion and powertrain technologies. With a market size of around 90 billion U.S. dollars, the machine tool industry is one of the key industries within the manufacturing sector. Above all, machine tools are used to cut or form rigid materials such as metal. The major areas of application include machinery manufacturing and vehicle production. Shenyang Group, DMG Mori Seiki, Yamazaki Mazak and Trumpf are ranked as the largest companies in this area. China, Japan and Germany are the most important producers of machine tools. Notwithstanding the fact that China is the main producer and consumer of machine tools already, the country is expected to continue gaining market share over the next decade. It is yet to be seen, how additive manufacturing will affect the sector, but this technology is predicted to be at the forefront of yet another industrial revolution. Although the idea to 3D-print turbines or cylinder blocks may sound like science fiction to the ears of laymen, 3D printing is already being used by a number of companies for the production of prototypes.

Commercially-produced energy is derived from fossil, nuclear and renewable sources. Nuclear and fossil fuels - such as coal, natural gas and oil - are supplied by the mining industries, while renewable energy is generated in small or large-scale systems with the help of turbines, pumps, collectors or photovoltaic modules. The main electricity sources comprise nuclear fuels, coal and natural gas, as well as solar, wind, biomass and hydropower sources. Electricity is generated in private or state-run electric utilities. The world\u2019s largest electric utilities include Duke Energy, GDF Suez, Iberdrola and E.ON. The demand side of energy can be broken down into the following sectors: industrial, transportation, residential, electric power and commercial. Approximately 40 percent of global power consumption is accounted for by the energy-guzzling industrial sector. The transportation sector uses petroleum products, biodiesel and natural gas. The power sector uses these and other fuels to generate electricity, which is the main source of energy in the residential and commercial sectors. Waste management and wastewater treatment are vital processes in meeting air and water quality standards. Furthermore, the recovering and recycling of materials found in waste streams is the right way to saving our planet\u2019s resources. The collection, transport and processing of waste is carried out by private or municipal companies, the largest one being Texas-headquartered Waste Management, Inc.

One of the industry\u2019s main goals is to increase the world\u2019s energy-efficiency, and to make the planet more environmentally benign. In order that these goals be achieved, the sector provides several other industries with the necessary technologies. The chief industry areas served by the environmental technology sector include clean city development, smart grid implementation, clean water provision, offshore and onshore wind turbine production, solar photovoltaic cell and module manufacturing, waste and wastewater management services, recycling services, green building construction and LED lighting deployment. To be classified as clean technology (or clean-tech), environmental technology projects need to fulfill a number of requirements, including the energy and resource-efficient use of sustainable materials. Thanks to supportive government policies, the green technology sector continues to attract investors across the globe. Although not particularly feted for its environmental awareness, China has became one of the largest renewable energy investment markets. Some of the key players in the highly fragmented clean technology industry include W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4, Hyundai, Vestas, NovaLED, Yingli, Tesla, Siemens, IBM and General Electric.

The work performed in this sector may include maintenance and repairs, as well as new work, additions and alterations. Furthermore, the sector includes on-site assembly of prefabricated, panelized or precut buildings. The construction of temporary buildings is also included in this subsector. Being one of the most important markets for construction, the United States has been hit hard by the 2008 economic crisis, at the center of which lay the underwriting of securities backed by subprime mortgages. However, the fact that the value of residential property is on the increase, in combination with a declining number of foreclosed and under water homes, cautiously hints at a housing market recovery throughout the nation. Beazer Homes, DR Horton, Hovnanian Enterprises, Lennar Corporation, NVR, Meritage Homes, Pulte Group, Ryland and Toll Brothers are counted among the leading homebuilders serving the market in the United States. In terms of non-residential buildings, the most sought-after categories include retail and private office space. In emerging markets, increasingly affluent consumers are predicted to drive demand for larger residential structures. In order to cater to the needs of a growing customer base, the industry is expected to turn to innovative solutions. Just like in the manufacturing sector, 3D printing is about to make inroads into the construction industry. This process is called additive building construction.

Insurance, essentially, is risk aversion. It is defined as being the equitable transfer of risk from one entity to another in exchange for payment. An insurer, or a carrier of insurance, is the company selling the insurance. The insured, also known as the policy holder, is the individual or entity purchasing the policy. The premium is the amount of money that is charged for a certain amount of insurance coverage. Insurance operates through pooling resources from a large number of insured entities, the pooling of funds allows the payment for the losses that some may incur. Potentially, any risk that is able to be quantified can be insured and for this reason there are a vast array of insurance policy types in existence, some of the most common ones include auto insurance, health insurance , accident, sickness and unemployment insurance, casualty insurance, life insurance, burial insurance and property insurance . Insurability, whether a certain type of loss can be insured in theory, is generally determined by whether the risks in question share common characteristics. When looking into taking out an insurance policy, it is advisable to search for the best priced package as prices often vary from one insurer to the next.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country located in the southern Hemisphere. The history of modern Australia started 223 years ago in 1788, when the first European settlers arrived on the continent, previously inhabited by Aboriginals for thousands of years. Originally intended as a colony for convicts in the late 18th century, the continent attracted more and more settlers from Europe as it developed, especially during the gold rush of the 1850s. In 2010, Australia had a total population of 21.47 million people. The majority of Australia\u2019s population is white with European descent. The indigenous Aboriginal population is largely marginalized and only makes up one percent of the total population. According to World Bank statistics, Australia is among the top ten immigration countries in the world with 5.5 million immigrants living in the country in 2010. Australia is a constitutional monarchy with a federal system of government. Queen Elizabeth II is Head of State, although she resides in Great Britain, and is represented in Australia by appointed Governors at both state and federal level. Australia\u2019s six states and two mainland territories have their own parliaments and governing bodies. Their primary responsibilities include schools, roads, public transportation and state-level police. Australia\u2019s economy is highly developed and is currently ranked 13th in a GDP-based ranking of the world\u2019s largest economies. The International Monetary Fund estimates Australia\u2019s 2010 GDP at 1.22 trillion U.S. dollars. Australia\u2019s economy has been growing steadily at around three percent per annum for the last two decades. Even during the global financial crisis, when most of the world\u2019s largest economies stumbled into recession, Australia managed to maintain a positive GDP growth rate. Australia\u2019s unemployment rate slightly increased during the crisis but was still at a moderate 5.2 percent in 2010 compared to 9.6 percent in the United States. Australia has had a negative balance of trade for many years, but rising commodity prices and the soaring demand from emerging markets in Asia have worked to the country\u2019s advantage. Amongst Australia\u2019s most important trading partners, you will find China and Japan, who accounted for more than 40 percent of Australia\u2019s exports in 2009. The standard of living in Australia is very high. In 2010, the country was ranked second in the United Nations\u2019 country ranking according to the Human Development Index, which is based on life expectancy, education and income per capita.

The counterparts of a good state of health are pain, injury or illness. The World Health Organization\u2019s definition of health says that it is \"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" There are lots of elements which determine a person\u2019s health situation such as income, social status, education, working conditions, infrastructure, as well as social and physical environments. Genetics, biology, culture and gender are further elements that have to be considered. Diseases of all kinds are among the most common reasons for deaths worldwide. For example, more than eight million people died globally from cancer alone in 2012. Many diseases influence health without causing death directly. Asthma and diabetes are typical examples, affecting hundreds of millions people worldwide and coincidentally leading to huge healthcare costs. Age and injuries are further key factors influencing the state of health. With growing age, the risk of contracting some diseases increases rapidly. Prevention and therapy are measurements to maintain a person\u2019s good health and improve a person\u2019s poor state of health respectively. Among the most commonly known preventions are all types of vaccinations which should prevent a possible disease in the future. In comparison, therapies (treatments) are usually given after a health problem has been diagnosed. Medication makes up a substantial part of therapies. But therapies can also include other forms such as physical or psychological treatment.

Common farming methods include conventional and organic farming. Conventional farming is the main farming method used during the 20th century and still dominates most farming today. Depending on national regulations, farmers are allowed to use chemical plant protectors and chemical fertilizers. The intensive mass livestock breeding is widely practiced. In contrast, the organic farming sector sets higher animal- and plant-friendly standards in order to protect natural resources and the environment. Specific laws and requirements regulate the organic crop production and livestock breeding. Organic farmers rely on methods such as crop rotation and biological pest control. Thus, they dispense the use of chemical fertilizer and use fertilizers and pesticides instead, which are considered as natural. Farming is divided in crop production and livestock breeding. Major crops in the United States include corn, soybean, hay and wheat. The agricultural livestock sector mainly concentrates on cattle and dairy farming, hog and pig farming, poultry and egg production, and sheep and goat farming. Dairy farming results in downstream manufacturing processes in order to produce milk and milk products for human consumption.

This includes information on topics and industry segments such as consulting, market research, staffing & personnel, call centers, facility management, and outsourcing. Outsourcing can be broadly defined as the outplacement or contracting of certain production stages of a product or a service to an external service provider. This is done mostly to save costs and to not use one\u2019s own resources for it. Subsegments of the outsourcing industry are for example information technology outsourcing (ITO), business process outsourcing (BPO), recruitment process outsourcing (RPO), legal process outsourcing (LPO), and knowledge process outsourcing (KPO). Consulting companies like McKinsey, Bain & Company, Deloitte, Accenture, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young and KPMG offer a diverse set of professional services and generate billions of dollars in revenue. The combined revenue of the so-called \u201cBig Four\u201d companies (Ernst&Young, PwC, Deloitte, KPMG), in relation to auditing and accounting, amounts to more than 100 billion U.S. dollars. Each of these four companies employs more than 100 thousand people worldwide. The market research industry thrives to gather, analyze and interpret information about a service and/or market. Amongst the leading companies in the industry are, for example, Nielsen and the Kantar Group. Both of these companies generate more than three billion U.S. dollars in annual revenue. According to the American Marketing Association, more than 35 thousand people were employed in the industry in the United States. Global sales of staffing and personnel services (agency work industry) amount to more than 250 billion U.S. dollars each year according to the International Confederation of Private Employment Agencies (Ciett). The U.S. market for temporary and contract staffing has an annual sales volume of around 100 billion U.S. dollars. Leading companies in the industry include Randstad, Manpower, Adecco, Kelly Services and the Allegis Group. Facility management services, which include for example building fabric, air conditioning, plumbing & drainage, fire safety system and lift & escalator maintenance, but also services such as cleaning, security, handyman services and waste disposal, are often provided by companies that specialize in these services or offer these services as part of a broader portfolio. The French food services and facilities management company Sodexo and the American company Aramark are examples of such companies. The Fluor Corporation, rooted in the construction industry, is another example of a company providing facility management services.

Questions that will be addressed include, for example, \u2019Where and how often do people shop \u2019, \u2018How many coupons do they redeem per week \u2019, or \u2018How much money do they spend on average on certain product items \u2019 Manufacturers, research companies, and ad agencies show special interest in topics covering differences between various ethnic groups such as Hispanic consumers or African-American customers. Data presenting age-specific contrasts between Millennials and Generation X are also typically appealing. In the age of mobile communication, more and more consumers are engaged in online shopping (even though the majority is still buying their products at brick-and-mortar stores). Recently, even food retailers started to offer their customers the possibility of online grocery shopping. From their perspective, it is interesting to know what factors drive consumers to do their grocery shopping online in order to provide the necessary customer-friendly services. Industry experts see significant potential for growth in the next couple of years. Shopping behavior around the holidays differs from regular shopping days. The latest figures, for example, showed notable differences between Memorial Day and a usual shopping weekday.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores The Federal Republic of Brazil is the largest country in South America and the Latin American region. It is the fifth largest country in the world, based both on geographical area and on population. The country occupies just under half of the continent of South America and is the largest Portuguese-speaking country in the world. It has almost 7,500 kilometers of coastline on the Atlantic Ocean and borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile. Brasilia, the country\u2019s capital, is also the country\u2019s fifth largest city, whilst Sao Paulo is the biggest city with over 20 million inhabitants as of 2014. The average age of the population in Brazil has risen steadily over the last fifty years and it is expected to exceed 30 years for the first time in 2015. This is, in part, due to the declining fertility rate and rise in life expectancy in the country. Brazil is also becoming increasingly urbanized, with over 85 percent of the population living in urban areas in 2013. Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking country in the Americas due to the fact that it was a Portuguese colony until 1808. Its independence was achieved in 1822 with the creation of the Empire of Brazil and it became a presidential republic in 1889. Brazil\u2019s current Constitution, formulated in 1988, defines it as a federal republic and it is composed of the Federal District, 26 states, and over 5,500 municipalities. The Brazilian president, as well as all members of the executive and legislative branches of government, is directly elected. Brazil has the world\u2019s seventh largest economy by both nominal GDP and purchasing power parity, as well as the largest national economy in Latin America. It is a member of the BRIC group and had, until 2010, been one of the world\u2019s fastest growing major economies. The steady growth rate of the GDP in recent years has seen the country gain new international recognition and influence. The Brazilian economy is characterized by moderately free markets and an inward-oriented outlook, but there are still major issues with corruption. Corruption within business and local government cost Brazil an estimated 53 billion U.S. dollars in 2013 alone, with the average annual cost of corruption between 1.3 and 2.3 percent of the country\u2019s total GDP. The service sector is the largest component of Brazil\u2019s GDP at almost 69.32 percent, followed by industry at just under 25 percent and agriculture at 5.7 percent. Among the country\u2019s diverse industries are steel, computers, aircraft and automobiles, with the latter becoming the fourth largest regional market in the world. The country\u2019s workforce is estimated at over 100 million, with 62.7 percent employed in the services industry. The unemployment rate has more than halved in the last ten years from 11.48 percent in 2004 to an estimated 5.5 percent in 2014. However, this figure is expected to rise marginally in the next few years as the country fell into recession in 2014. Brazil has been the world\u2019s largest producer of coffee for the last 150 years and is also the largest exporter of soybeans and sugar cane. Overall, Brazil\u2019s export of goods was worth over 242 billion U.S. dollars in 2013, with the U.S. and China being its two biggest export partners. The country\u2019s largest company is Petrobas, a multinational energy corporation headquartered in Rio de Janiero, which generated revenue of around 130 billion U.S. dollars in 2013. A significant sector of Brazil\u2019s service industry is its banking sector, which accounted for as much as 16 percent of the country\u2019s GDP in the early 1990s. Today, the financial services industry provides local businesses with a wide range of products, and Brazil\u2019s national development bank, BNDES, plays an important role in the country\u2019s economic growth. Tourism is also a growing sector in Brazil and is key to the economy of several regions of the country. Brazil had an estimated 5.7 million visitors in 2012, with Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo amongst the most popular destinations for international tourists. Many of these tourists come from nearby Argentina and the United States, although large numbers also visit from Germany and other European countries. The 2014 World Cup in Brazil also boosted the tourism industry, with estimates showing that tourist spending in restaurants and bars increased 273 percent during the World Cup compared to the same period in the previous year.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores The People\u2019s Republic of China was founded in 1949. Located in East Asia, China is the most populous country in the world. The population growth in China makes for some impressive figures. In 2011, the total population of China was around 1.35 billion people. Life expectancy in China was 73.3 years for people born in 2009. China is a single-party state run by the Communist Party of China. The past two decades have witnessed an unprecedented period of breakneck growth and rapid development in China\u2019s economy, a world away from the lengthy period of stagnation seen under Mao Zedong. The distribution of the workforce across economic sectors in China is one of the statistical examples confirming these developments. Double-digit GDP growth rates are no rarity in China, and the country seems to be on track to overtake the United States as the world\u2019s largest economy within the next decade. In 2010, the GDP of China was 5.88 trillion U.S. dollars. China\u2019s rapid growth has attracted vast amounts of foreign direct investment (FDI)..Statistics relating to China show the country is now the third largest recipient of foreign direct investments. In 2009, U.S. investors held almost 50 billion U.S. dollars of FDI in China. Statistics relating to the staggering monthly value of exports in China are endorsed by some impressive figures. In 2009, statistics about China indicated that the country had overtaken Germany as the world\u2019s leading exporter and it now tops the ranking of the world\u2019s largest export nations with a total export value of 1.58 trillion U.S. dollars in 2010. In 2009, more than 20 percent of China\u2019s exports went to the U.S., making the United States China\u2019s most important trading partner. Statistics on the unemployment rate in China show that it has been practically stable for the last decade. In 2010, unemployment statistics indicated that 4.1 percent of China\u2019s workforce was unemployed compared to 9.6 percent in the U.S. With a cultural heritage stretching back almost 4,000 years, China has one of the oldest continuous cultures on the planet. Many of today\u2019s basics such as paper and gunpowder can be traced back through Chinese history. Statistical figures relating to the business expectation index in China showcase many exciting trends in the country's development and it will be fascinating to see where they will lead in the coming years. Particularly since China is considered to be the next challenger to the status of the United States as the main global superpower.

Real estate, property consisting of the land and the buildings on it, including its natural resources, can be rented or leased. The practice of renting is an agreement that exists between a tenant and a landlord whereby the tenant makes payment for the temporary use of a property. There are a number of reasons for deciding to rent a property instead of buying. The most obvious is that of financial inadequacy, many may not be able to afford the full price that ownership would require, whereas others may be unwilling to take on the financing risks that come with ownership, such as the depreciation in value that can result from periods of economic instability. It has been widely reported that the recent financial crisis has directly contributed to the rapid growth that has been seen in rental market places. Leasing , essentially, has a great deal of similarities to the principle of \u2018borrowing\u2019. Ownership is not transferred under a lease agreement, but the lease gives the lessee the right to use the assets that are covered under the agreement for the period stipulated under the contract.

This includes information on segments and industries such as social networks, content creation and curation, social apps as well as statistics on demographics and use. Currently, there are more than 1.6 billion social network users worldwide with more than 64 percent of internet users accessing social media services online. According to statistics, social networking is one of the most popular ways for online users to spend their time, enabling them to stay in contact with friends and families as well as catching up with news and other content. Current industry data indicates that more than half of the internet users in North America are social network users. In the United States, these figures amount to more than 160 million users who access social networking sites via any device at least once per month. In mid-2013, Facebook accounted for more than half of all social media site visits in the United States, placing it first among the most popular social network ranking, followed by Google-owned video site YouTube and Twitter. With more than 1.1 billion monthly active users, Facebook is also the most popular social network worldwide. Despite Facebook being the absolute market leader in terms of MAU, other social networks have thrived nonetheless. Some social networks such as LinkedIn have specialized in professional networking, whereas others such as Chinese-language Qzone or Renren cater to huge local audiences. A wide selection of social networks also heavily relies on user-generated content: image-heavy Tumblr, Instagram and Pinterest are home to content-creating and digitally curating users. The spread of smartphones and tablets has lead to the increase of mobile social networks. According to market data, social media marketing and social commerce are also two up-and-coming industries with strong revenue potential.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores This page provides statistics, facts and market data related to digital payments. This includes information on popular payment methods, transaction volume as well as demographics and country-specific online payments. The topic of digital payments is integral to the field of e-commerce and includes a number of types of electronic funds transfers, from online credit and debit card use to electronic checks and electronic money. Near field communication (NFC) payment systems and the use of online payment service providers, such as PayPal and Google Wallet, are also covered in this section. Market data shows that the popularity of each type of mobile payment varies by region and the type of device used for purchasing. The eBay-owned PayPal, one of the more popular online payment service providers, has seen a steady increase in payment volume over the last several years. The idea of a mobile wallet, especially used to make payments at an in-store point-of-sale (i.e. with NFC), is still developing, but statistics show that it is slowly gathering steam. As the use of digital payment increases, the security of these online transactions also grows in importance, as is evidenced by the multiple measures taken by users to secure their information. Many people abstain from using any mobile payment methods due to, among other security concerns, fears of data misuse or interception. Despite these reservations, the convenience of digital payments for online orders of physical goods as well as paid digital content is rather alluring, as is indicated by the growing number of mobile payment users worldwide.

This process comes mainly through purification, distillation and conversion of crude oil in refineries. Oil refineries are large industrial complexes, noticeable mainly by their tank farms, pipeline systems and flare systems. The best known refinery products are petroleum naphtha, diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene, heating oil, LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) and asphalt base. Refinery products can have gaseous, fluid and solid forms. On average, around one quarter of a modern oil refinery\u2019s production is gasoline, while one fifth is diesel fuel and light heating oil. Approximately one tenth make naphtha (crude gasoline) and heavy heating oil, respectively. However, this depends on the types of crude oil as well as on the production methods of the plant. Refined oil products play a major role in modern life. Gasoline and diesel are inevitable for the whole automotive market, while kerosene/jet fuel is needed in aeronautics. Naturally, the petrochemical industry is highly dependent on petroleum and some natural gas products. This is why petrochemical plants are often located near oil and gas refineries. Interestingly, many active substances in medicines are derived from refined crude oil products, mostly from naphtha. Feel free to contact us anytime using our contact form or visit our FAQ page.

Many products used in everyday life include organic substances generated by the petrochemical industry. Colorants, plastics, coatings, detergents, synthetic fibers and medicines are the most prominent examples. Inorganic chemistry forms another important part of the chemical industry. It includes the chemistry of carbon-free compounds. Historically, inorganic chemistry meant substances that were not created by organic life. However, this distinction is far from clear, because it is possible to produce organic substances from inorganic compounds. Inorganic chemistry is the base for many technical areas like semi-conductors and metallurgy. Agricultural chemistry is a segment that has became more and more important with the rapid growth of the global population. In the meanwhile, world acreage for food supply is shrinking, because many areas are used for the production of commodities for biofuels. This dilemma can only be managed by the extensive use of agrochemical products such as herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and fertilizers, to maximize yields per hectare. Trends show that agrochemical companies are becoming increasingly involved in biotechnology and genetic engineering.

We offer customized research & analysis services. Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores In this section, Statista presents the most relevant and up-to-date facts relating to the manufacture of aerial vehicles. Aircraft manufacturing can be broken down to a defense and a commercial segment. While military aviation is likely to see a decline in revenue due to cuts in military spending, commercial aircraft production is forecast to experience a boom. In light of continued passenger traffic growth, airlines are expected to add new models to their fleets. Boeing\u2019s Dreamliner and Airbus Group\u2019s A350 are predicted to become the most sought-after models in this sector. The two largest jet manufacturers are the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), which is the parent company of Airbus, and Illinois-headquartered Boeing. Since Boeing\u2019s 1997 merger with its former rival McDonnell Douglas, the aircraft manufacturing industry has often been characterized as a de facto duopoly. The two aforementioned companies share between them about 65 percent of the world airliner fleet. Canada\u2019s Bombardier, Brazil\u2019s Embraer and Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries are competing for the remaining market share. General Electric and United Technologies Corporation are ranked among the most important suppliers of aircraft engines and parts. The key contractors of military aircraft include Europe\u2019s EADS, as well as US-based Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman.

Desde entonces estas caminatas, bajo un lema que no es sino la traducci\u00f3n de su nombre original en ingl\u00e9s \"Walk for freedom\", no han hecho sino crecer hasta aproximarse a las 500 marchas en m\u00e1s de 50 pa\u00edses en 2018.

Arts and culture are composed of numerous segments with different focuses; at the core are the visual arts, which include painting, sculpture, printmaking, photography, and other visual media. In a way, theater, film, music, dance, and other performing arts. Literature and interactive media can also be considered part of the arts. Today, many pieces of art can fetch millions of dollars at auctions, some are even surpassing the one-hundred million mark. Many museums and other cultural institutions, such as the Smithsonian Institution in the United States, are under governmental administration, or are public institutions that receive public funding. Foundations, endowments, donations and trusts also play a major role in the arts and culture field. Libraries can be considered one of the backbones to arts and culture, since they present people with the opportunity to gather information and educate themselves about their fields of interest. The vast majority of the more than 100 thousand libraries in the United States are school libraries.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores One of the most marked developments in the field of telecommunications and technology in the last few decades has been enabling people to get in touch with one another quickly, through numerous means, while on the go. Communications and its ever-strengthening connection to mobility has become the most significant telecommunications development of recent years; allowing people to juggle daily schedules, home life and work. Major tech companies like Apple, manufacture such devices and constantly develop them so that they continue to meet new organisational challenges presented during the course of every day life. Statistics dealing with the telecommunication industry display many current and exciting trends in this field. Wireless telecommunication was first achieved with the invention of the radio at the beginning of the 20th century. This revolutionized and significantly sped up communication over long distances, as a new, quick way of sending and receiving information. Telecommunications, in its most basic, simple form consist of a transmitter, a transmission medium or channel and a receiver. Nowadays, however, this lucrative, complex and secretive industry is an ever raging battle for intellectual property, patents, court cases and injunctions. All deemed necessary to retain an edge in the market. Telecommunication statistics on worldwide revenue from telecommunications services paint an interesting picture of the ever-changing, constantly developing industry and include a forecast of developments to come. In 2011, over one trillion euros of revenue was generated in the telecommunications industry. In just three years\u2019 time, this figure is expected to continue to rise and rise. Worldwide revenue from telecommunications equipment also gives an impressive overview of the industry. Back in 2005, revenue stood at 196 billion euros. In 2011, this figure had grown to an astonishing 256 billion euros. In 2014, revenue is expected to further rise to 274 billion euros. The general trend over the years has been in the direction of growth; to date, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any sign of a stall in growth. There are several large telecommunication providers in Europe, among them: Deutsche Telecom, Telefonica, Vodafone, France Telecom, Telecom Italia. As of 2009, Germany\u2019s Deutsche Telecom topped the list with revenue of over 64 billion euros. Spain\u2019s Telefonica followed with over 56 billion. In fact, according to statistics, Europe has consistently shown the highest revenue in telecommunication services by region over the last six years. In 2010, 317 billion euros were spent in this area in Europe, compared to 239 billion in North America. Based on figures on wireless operating revenue of major U.S. telecommunication providers, Verizon led the industry with revenue of over 63 billion euros in 2010. AT&T followed with 58.5 billion euros in revenue. The number of active mobile broadband subscriptions worldwide rose from 73 million to over one billion in the last six years alone. As of September 2011, the number of mobile phone subscriptions was led by China Mobile, which had more than 633 million subscribers, Vodafone in the UK followed with 391 million, while Deutsche Telecom was trailing with 128.5 million.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores In this section, Statista presents the most relevant and up-to-date facts relating to the transportation and logistics industries. Today, there is a plethora of transport modes around the world, the most dominant ones being road and rail transport, as well as ship transport and aviation. Global passenger demand is on the rise both in mature and emerging markets, where the population is becoming increasingly affluent and mobile. Despite the growing number of bicycles, motorcycles, coaches, trains, planes and even cruise ships in use, the automobile is still the most popular form of passenger travel. Thanks to the car\u2019s popularity, the automotive industry has made a strong comeback from the 2008 financial crisis. Toyota, General Motors and VW are ranked as the largest passenger car manufacturers worldwide. The Volkswagen Group is also counted among the world\u2019s leading truck manufacturers, trailing only Germany\u2019s Daimler and China\u2019s Dongfeng. In terms of cargo transportation, trade relations between China, North America and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) are forecast to drive up traffic demand over the coming years. While cargo aircraft are often used to transport mail, animals and dangerous items, bulk products are typically carried by railways, trucks and ships. In the logistics industry, intermodal freight traffic is the most common choice to move consumer goods. Intermodal transport facilitates and expedites cargo traffic because the freight is shipped in containers that move interchangeably by commercial vehicles, railroads and container ships.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores This page provides statistics, facts and market data related to key figures of e-commerce. This includes information on online sales revenues and numbers of online shoppers, as well as demographics of online purchasers and country-specific e-commerce numbers. E-commerce sales have climbed remarkably steadily for years, with continuous further growth expected. A number of industries receive much more than half of their sales from online buyers as consumers take advantage of individual company retail websites as well as online-only based retailers which also provide C2C services, such as Amazon and eBay. The total number of digital shoppers worldwide grew by over 100 million between 2011 and 2012, and is expected to keep on growing. Information on the number of digital buyers and online shopper penetration per region or country is available in this category as well. As the BRIC countries grow in worldwide economic importance, researchers have started to focus on those particular markets, providing information on the share of internet economy in the GDP and the reach of retail websites across Brazil, Russia, India and China. Market penetration is already remarkably high in other countries such as the United States. As of 2011, market data showed that over 70 percent of all adult internet users in the United States made online purchases, leaning mainly toward internet sites and e-mail offers to help them choose their desired product. Trusted companies with a broad range of product offerings online, such as Amazon and eBay, attracted the largest number of visitors to their websites in 2013. Amazon easily claims title of the top dog in e-commerce with its net sales revenue more than doubling in the past three years and its audience comprised of visitors from all around the globe.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores Shopping and factory outlets represent significant institutions in modern Western culture. They are a conglomeration of buildings, or one large building, containing various businesses, stores and restaurants with a common interest in soliciting sales. The facilities are developed as planned commercial locations and typically offer private, off-street parking facilities. Today, urban fabric and shopping mall integration is becoming more important. Open space and sustainable design for shopping malls are the rising trends in the world. Existing shopping malls are opening, integrating with urban fabric and continually updating themselves to compete with the emerging shopping places. Shopping malls used to be very linear in their construction and they were anchored by the big department stores. That dynamic has changed for a myriad of reasons that include issues of urban sprawl, technology and the evolution of consumer habits. What we're currently seeing are more shopping malls that have a more circular construction to them. They almost look like giant spiders whose arms might have a department store or two. Entertainment activities, though, trump the mega-stores. Movie theaters, cafes, restaurants, comedy clubs, mini-putt and more have turned shopping centers into entertainment centers. The stores that are performing the best are becoming hyper-focused on providing much more than just something to buy. Faced with the exploding popularity of buying online, shopping malls are emptying and are seeking new solutions to generate traffic. A number of brands have their own apps. Now shopping centers and malls are joining the fray.

We will only forward your data to providers or storage locations in countries outside the European Union to the extent that such is necessary to process orders and perform contracts. 4. Deletion periods We will retain your data until such time as the order has been completed or the statutory retention periods have expired.

Voluntary provision of data You are not obligated to provide us with your data. You may, therefore, refuse to have your IP address saved. In order to conclude and perform contracts between you and us, the processing of your data in the scope described above is, however, necessary.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores This page provides statistics, facts and market data related to sports and fitness, including information on sports & activities, wellness, health & spa, sporting events & marketing, and professional sports. Professional sports is a billion dollar business today, generating revenue from a number of streams such as media rights (TV), ticketing, sponsorships, endorsements, and merchandising as well as for example sales of sporting goods with ties to professional sports. In North America, the National Football League (NFL), Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA), and the National Hockey League (NHL) are considered the four major sports leagues. In terms of overall popularity and prevalence, soccer \u2013 or football, as how it is known in most parts of the world \u2013 is probably the number one sport worldwide. Europe is still the premier market for the sport with total annual revenues at around 20 billion euros. The so-called \u2018Big-Five\u2019 leagues generate around 50 percent of that revenue. Physical activity is an important part of the daily life of millions of people around the world. In the United States, people spend around half an hour per day on sports, exercise and recreation. Amongst popular outdoor activities are hiking, camping, biking, running & jogging, and fishing.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores On this page you can find statistics, facts, market data and further information on the restaurant industry, including industry-specific segmental breakdowns of products and services. The restaurant/hospitality industry is highly competitive and diversified in regard to its products and how they are presented and sold to the restaurant patrons. It can be broadly divided into two categories: the commercial restaurant and foodservice segment, and the noncommercial foodservice segment. In the United States, for example, the commercial segment makes up about 80 percent of the market, while the noncommercial segment accounts for the remaining 20 percent. According to estimates from the National Restaurant Association, the annual revenue from food and drink sales in the United States is at more than 600 billion U.S. dollars. The commercial segment includes all types of restaurants in the full-service and quick-service / limited-service segments of the industry as well as foodservice operations in locations as diverse as stadiums, airlines and cruise ships. The full-service segment includes family dining, casual dining and fine dining restaurants. An example of a family dining restaurant is the restaurant chain IHOP (International House of Pancakes). The restaurant chains Applebee\u2019s, Chili\u2019s Grill & Bar, Olive Garden, Red Lobster, and Buffalo Wild Wings are considered casual dining chains. Enterprises in the fine dining segment are more likely to be single unit operations, but there also chains in the segment with more than 50 units, like Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House. Typical characteristics of limited-service / quick-service restaurants (QSR) are serving the customer as quickly as possible and usually offering the food at cheaper prices than full-service establishments. QSR / limited-service restaurants are often part of a chain, such as McDonald\u2019s, Subway, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Burger King, and Wendy\u2019s. The total revenue of U.S. fast food / limited-service restaurants is estimated to amount to between 170 and 200 billion U.S. dollars. QSR, coffeehouse and pizza (delivery) chains are major players in the U.S. foodservice and restaurant market. McDonald\u2019s, for example, operates or franchises more than 34 thousand restaurants worldwide, generating revenues in excess of 27 billion U.S. dollars. According to \u2018Brands Top 100\u2019, published by MilwardBrown, McDonald\u2019s is the most valuable fast food brand in the world with a brand value of 95 billion U.S. dollars. Starbucks places second in this ranking of brands with an ascribed brand value of 17 billion U.S. dollars. The coffee house chain is the market leader in its segment with almost 15 billion U.S. dollars in revenue and almost 20 thousand stores worldwide. Total employment in the U.S. restaurant industry was estimated at around 10 million by the National Restaurant Association. About 4.7 million of those jobs are attributable to the full-service segment, 3.7 million are within the quick-service restaurant segment and 1.6 million employees work at establishments in other restaurant segments such as cafeterias/grill buffets, snack/nonalcoholic beverage bars, food service contractors, caterers/mobile foodservice, and bars & taverns. The employees work at more than 600 thousand restaurants throughout the U.S. Picture: sxc.hu / EgahenShow more Feel free to contact us anytime using our contact form or visit our FAQ page.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores In this section, Statista presents the most relevant and up-to-date facts relating to the logistics industry. Before a product can be displayed on a supermarket shelf or dispatched from a post office, it has to be transported from its point of origin to its destination. Depending on the weight, volume and destination of goods, the cargo can be moved by land, air or water. The logistics industry involves warehousing, material handling, packaging and the integration of information flow through supply chain management software. Over the next couple of years, the share of e-commerce in total retail sales is likely to grow, as end-users are inclined to shun traditional stores and retreat to the comfort of their own homes. This shift from retail to e-tail leaves one big opportunity for logistics companies: to deliver the increasing number of goods that are purchased online. The strategic battle for this last mile is set to be a hard-fought one, played out between online retailers and logistics companies alike. The key players in this industry include Deutsche Post DHL, United Parcel Service or JSC Russian Railways. Additionally, online retailers and tech firms such as Amazon, Google and Japan\u2019s Rakuten are keen to tap into the logistics market and further expand their supply chains.

We offer customized research & analysis services. Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores In this section, Statista presents the most relevant and up-to-date facts relating to the electric power sector. Coal, natural gas and nuclear fuels are the most important sources for electricity generation worldwide. Natural gas in particular and, to a certain extent, shale oil have transformed themselves into cheap and reliable energy sources as a result of improved hydraulic fracturing (\u201cfracking\u201d) and horizontal drilling methods, enabling the energy industry to release unprecedented quantities of the precious liquids from deposits that were previously thought either inaccessible or uneconomic: Shale oil is estimated to be economic at prices of around 70 U.S. dollars per barrel. Despite the prevalence of non-renewable fuels, electric power can also be derived from renewable sources, including wind power, hydropower and solar photovoltaic power. Typically, electric current is generated by utility companies and delivered to end customers via large unidirectional power networks. The world\u2019s largest electric utilities include Duke, GDF Suez and E.ON. In traditional electric power grids, about 40 percent of electricity is lost in the process of delivering electricity to end customers. In order to reduce such losses, governments worldwide are pondering the introduction of smart grids. The new networks will support the increased generation of renewable electricity and facilitate the connection of electric vehicles to the grid. Unlike traditional power systems, smart grids are multidirectional networks, allowing the feed-in of power produced by residential and other small-scale renewable energy producers near electric utilities or in remote regions. Smart grids also enable the monitoring and measuring of electricity. The leading companies in the area of electric metering include IBM, Cisco, Honeywell, General Electric, Trilliant Networks and Itron.

This includes information on segments and industries such as search engine usage, market reach, search volume as well as statistics on demographics and use. Online search is one of the most popular web activities worldwide. Internet users can search for information on the World Wide Web using search engines or global search portals such as Google, Yahoo and other local variants such as Yandex, Baidu or Naver. The results are usually presented on search engine result pages with items ranked by relevancy and other factors determined by the search engines search algorithm. Google is the worldwide search market leader with a constant global market share around 90 percent. In the United States, Google is also ranked first among unique visitors and core searches. Recent online search figures indicate heavy online search usage in European countries. Web search is frequently used during online travel planning or product research and has been vital in the growth of mobile commerce and smartphone shopping. Current statistics show that shoppers use their mobile devices to utilize online search before and during shopping, as mobile search helps them find opening hours, pricing comparisons and product information. Mobile search on smart devices has thus become a fixed part of brick-and-mortar retail. To increase the visibility of their products and appear at the top of search engine results, companies have to optimize their websites through SEO, short for search engine optimization.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores The industry Tobacco provides statistics, facts and market data on different tobacco products and addresses questions concerning smoking habits. Tobacco is a plant product containing mainly nicotine, cellulose, ammonia, and protein. In order that tobacco may be made suitable for human consumption, the tobacco leaves are dried and cured. Various tobacco products can be manufactured from the processed dried leaves including cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco, pipe tobacco and shisha tobacco. In the last decades, the tobacco industry has experienced a forming transformation. Led by the anti-smoking lobby, a wide range of laws and regulations have been implemented. In the age of tobacco regulation, milestones have been the prohibition of cigarette advertising on television and radio and the introduction of smoking-free flights. With the intention of making taking up smoking less appealing, manufacturers are obliged to print prominent health warnings on tobacco packaging. In the United States, the legal smoking age varies by state and starts around 18 years. In addition, smoking bans and taxes are regulated individually by each state. Some states have implemented statewide smoking bans in all enclosed public places. On the manufacturer side, the industry is shaped by key players including British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco, Japan Tobacco International, and Philip Morris International.

Among the well known parts of care and support are nursing, elderly care and home care. Elderly care has become an increasingly discussed issue due to the fact that populations in many developed countries have a disproportionate number of old people. In the United States, some 40 million persons are 65 years and older. Many of them need to be looked after in one way or the other. According to some projections, the number of older people in the United States will be twice as much in 2030 as it was in 2000. This fact clearly illustrates the progressive nature of caregiving in the U.S. and other modern societies. There will be an increasing need for caregivers and care facilities in the future. Elderly care is often connected to home care, because many older people are used to getting help at home. This is no surprise because the largest share of home care in the United States is provided by families and friends. Essential parts of home care include everyday activities like washing, dressing, transferring, eating, using the toilet, etc. But there are also professionals who provide home health care, such as nurses, physical therapists and home care aides. Home care, besides older people, can also include other groups. Disabled persons or war veterans are also often bound to home care.
