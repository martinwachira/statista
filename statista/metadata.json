Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores In this section, Statista presents the most relevant and up-to-date facts relating to the transportation and logistics industries. Today, there is a plethora of transport modes around the world, the most dominant ones being road and rail transport, as well as ship transport and aviation. Global passenger demand is on the rise both in mature and emerging markets, where the population is becoming increasingly affluent and mobile. Despite the growing number of bicycles, motorcycles, coaches, trains, planes and even cruise ships in use, the automobile is still the most popular form of passenger travel. Thanks to the car\u2019s popularity, the automotive industry has made a strong comeback from the 2008 financial crisis. Toyota, General Motors and VW are ranked as the largest passenger car manufacturers worldwide. The Volkswagen Group is also counted among the world\u2019s leading truck manufacturers, trailing only Germany\u2019s Daimler and China\u2019s Dongfeng. In terms of cargo transportation, trade relations between China, North America and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) are forecast to drive up traffic demand over the coming years. While cargo aircraft are often used to transport mail, animals and dangerous items, bulk products are typically carried by railways, trucks and ships. In the logistics industry, intermodal freight traffic is the most common choice to move consumer goods. Intermodal transport facilitates and expedites cargo traffic because the freight is shipped in containers that move interchangeably by commercial vehicles, railroads and container ships.

This includes, for example, information on restaurants, restaurant chains, food services, hotels, business and leisure travel, holiday destinations and activities, camping, and the cruise industry. The travel & tourism sector has developed into an industry with an annual economic impact (direct, indirect and induced) of around 6.5 trillion U.S. dollars worldwide. In 2012, the number of international tourist arrivals exceeded the one billion mark for the first time, an increase of almost 50 percent compared to ten years earlier. International travelers from China, Germany and the United States are amongst the biggest spenders worldwide. The global hotel industry generates approximately between 400 and 500 billion U.S. dollars in revenue each year, one third of that revenue is attributable to the United States. Some of the biggest hotel chains (groups) are the InterContinental Hotels Group, Marriott International, Hilton Worldwide, Accor, Starwood Hotels & Resorts, and the Wyndham Hotel Group. Three of the most important hotel performance indicators are the Average Daily Rate (ADR), the revenue per available room (RevPar), and the occupancy rate. The hospitality and restaurant industry is a diverse and highly competitive industry. Among the competitors in the industry are single sandwich shops, coffee shops and restaurants, coffeehouses, pizza and quick-service restaurant chains, and also high-end, luxury fine-dining restaurants, offering the customer a vast variety of choices. Estimations put the overall revenue from food and drink sales in the United States at more than 600 billion U.S. dollars. Major players in the industry include McDonald\u2019s (limited-service segment) with more than 34 thousand restaurants worldwide, the coffeehouse chain Starbucks \u2013 with more than 19 thousand stores worldwide \u2013 and Domino\u2019s Pizza in the pizza chain segment.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores In this section, statistics and market figures relating to the consumer goods industry are presented. Consumer goods are goods which are intended for everyday private consumption. They cover a large product portfolio including food and non-food categories in order to meet consumer demand. They are further classified in fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) and slow moving consumer goods (SMCG). The definitions are based on how fast products are sold to the customer, a determining factor in the rotation of goods. FMCG are goods with a useful life shorter than a year and include product categories such as food and beverages, personal care, household and cleaning products, apparel and footwear, tobacco and pet food/pet care which are products bought relatively frequently with recurring expenditure. SMCG are goods with a useful life longer than a year comprising items such as household appliances, furniture and home improvement products. These items have a lower sales frequency and are not rotating as rapidly as FMCG. The competitive landscape of the consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry is shaped by global leading CPG companies such as US-based Procter & Gamble (P&G), Unilever, L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Nestl\u00e9. Many companies invest large amounts of money for the development of new products in accordance with recent market trends and the latest research findings. As many manufacturers operate globally, product packaging and labeling regulations have to be fulfilled in order to meet the country-specific requirements. In addition, product formulas may have to be adapted to suit different consumer tastes.

Whether or not you are a customer, and whether or not any agreement even exists between us, is irrelevant in this case. By providing you with this information, we aim to make the manner in which we handle your data transparent for you. 1. Data controller The controller within the legal sense for all data-related issues is the company named in the \u201cLegal notice\u201d section of our website. You can contact one of the company representatives named there or our Data Protection Officer: Rechtsanwalt Maximilian Conrad Raabestr. 1 10405 Berlin Germany A Data Protection Officer is not bound to management\u2019s instructions. You can also contact him/her by e-mail: dataprotection@statista.com. 2. Procedure and purpose of storage Your computer sends us your IP address when you use our websites and, depending on the type of use and your computer\u2019s settings, we may store small text files (\u201ccookies\u201d) on your hard drive. We create these files to improve the function of our website for you. It is a sort of short-term memory on your browser. We also create text files on our system that may contain the following information about you: The type and version of your browser, the operating system used, the URL of the website from which you came to ours, the name of your computer and the time (\u201clog files\u201d). The log files cannot be directly linked to specific individuals. We do not combine this data with cookies or IP addresses. However, we reserve the right to evaluate this data retroactively in individual cases where we have specific indications that such data is being used unlawfully. The log files help us to understand on what types of computer our websites have to function properly and at what times our websites are visited more (or less) frequently. With the information provided by these files, we can adjust our website structure, servers and database systems accordingly. If you set up a user account with us or enter into a contract with us as a customer (e.g. goods order, newsletter subscription), we create a customer account in our system. This includes the master data provided by you, your order details and, where necessary, your accounting details (\u201ccustomer data\u201d). We store and process this data, because we would otherwise not be able to perform the contract with you. If you send us a job application, we will use all of the information provided on it to process your application. If your application is rejected, your data will be deleted six months after notification of this rejection, unless you have given us prior permission to contact you again. If you are employed by our company, your application documents, master data, accounting data and insurance data will be stored for the purpose of performing the employment relationship and forwarded to the partner companies listed below to the extent that such is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of the employer. 3. Forwarding the data to third parties We do not process all of your data by ourselves, but use the programs and services of other companies (\u201ctools\u201d). We will change the tools we use from time to time, where it makes sense to do so for legal, technical or economic reasons. We currently use the following tools for the management and provision of data (particularly customer data, IP addresses, cookies and log files): \u2022 Google Analytics (records number of visitors to the website) \u2022 Amazon web services (website operation, server location) \u2022 Datev (master data management, accounting) \u2022 Personio (HR management) \u2022 HRworks (travel expense accounting) \u2022 Microsoft Exchange server (contact data, emails) \u2022 Mailchimp (contact data, emails to large groups) \u2022 Contact Monkey (email tracking) \u2022 Userlike (provision of service chat windows on the website) \u2022 Slack (in-house communication) \u2022 Stripe (payment processing) \u2022 Nfon (internal and external calls) \u2022 Limesurvey (expert surveys) If you do not consent to the use of these tools, we may no longer be able to perform contracts concluded between us, or may have to switch to solutions that are less convenient for you. We will only forward your data to providers or storage locations in countries outside the European Union to the extent that such is necessary to process orders and perform contracts. 4. Deletion periods We will retain your data until such time as the order has been completed or the statutory retention periods have expired. These are defined, in particular, in Section 27 HGB (German Commercial Code), where the retention periods for business documents are regulated. 5. Information You have the statutory right to request information on the data stored by us at any time. In spite of our endeavors to ensure that data is correct and up-to-date, should we have stored incorrect data relating to you, we will correct said data as quickly as possible at your request. Where you have given your consent to data processing, you may withdraw it at any time with effect for the future. 6. Supervisory authority If you feel that we have failed to meet our obligation to inform, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (e.g. the Data Protection Officer of a German Federal State). 7. Voluntary provision of data You are not obligated to provide us with your data. You may, therefore, refuse to have your IP address saved. In order to conclude and perform contracts between you and us, the processing of your data in the scope described above is, however, necessary. If you withdraw your consent to data processing, this shall render performance on our part impossible, although this shall not release you from your obligation to perform. (For this reason, you may not object to the storage of your customer data in the above-mentioned management systems until such time as the contractual relationship has ended). 8. Alternative purpose If we intend to process your data further for a purpose other than that for which you made the data available to us, we shall provide you with specific information on this alternative purpose and the reason why we intend to use your data for it. You may withdraw your consent to further processing at any time. Click here for a free PDF reader.

In an October poll of more than 1,000 Gen Z college students, the National Retail Federation discovered 46 percent will use social media to spark creativity during the holiday season. 82 percent of college students will use Instagram. Second most popular is YouTube at 48 percent, followed by Pinterest at 44 percent. Snapchat is in the middle of the list with 35 percent. Toward the bottom are Facebook and Twitter, which fell at 34 percent and 33 percent, respectively. At 10 percent, TikTok is the least popular form of social media to use for inspiration. The video-sharing app is widely popular among Gen Z. It has been downloaded more than 1 billion times worldwide and was one of the most popular apps of 2018. TikTok\u2019s popularity continues to grow, especially among the younger generations. Retailers and brands aren\u2019t popular on the platform yet, though companies like Guess and Chipotle have tried to create one of their own viral marketing campaigns to potentially tap into Gen Z\u2019s propensity to participate in viral challenges.

Current internet user figures suggest that there are more than 2.5 billion users worldwide with a global penetration rate of 35 percent with North America accounting for 14 percent of global internet users. Since the late 1990s, the internet has not only provided users with online experiences such as email, online search and general browsing but has also played a major role in enabling human interaction and reshaping traditional communications media such as film, television, music and telephone. The mainstreaming of internet features, such as digital music and video, user-generated content and digital media sales, have caused traditional media consumption to undergo significant changes. With the large-scale offerings of user-generated as well as licensed content in the forms of audio, video, games and writings, companies such as YouTube, Netflix, Spotify, Pandora and Tumblr have broadened the selection of available entertainment and enabled internet users to interact more closely with the media and each other. The emergences of new digital technologies and websites have accelerated forms of human interaction through online forums, instant messaging, and social networking (since the mid-2000\u2019s). Email has been a staple of the online experience. However, the rise of social networks, most notably market leader Facebook, and mobile social apps such as Twitter, LINE or WhatsApp have changed the notion of online communications and the divide of the personal and public online space. Facebook has more than 1.2 billion monthly active users, presenting a global reach of almost 50 percent of internet users worldwide. According to internet market data, online sales via B2B and B2C e-commerce have not only expanded the reach and volume of traditional wholesale and retail trade but have also changed entire business infrastructures across various industries. The reach of online commerce has also enabled small and independent business owners to pursue their business ventures across local borders. Market data suggests a steady growth of global digital buyer penetration. Online shopping is not the only way of making money via the internet \u2013 statistics suggest a growth of digital content sales via e-commerce platforms such as iTunes, Google Play or Steam as well as the vast market of online advertising and marketing. Global companies such as Google, Amazon and Baidu generate the majority of their revenues via online services. Whereas the majority of internet access used to be via a fixed-line connection to a desktop PC, the growth of mobile technologies such as WiFi and laptops as well as mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers have completely changed the online landscape. In countries with weak technological infrastructures, mobile internet has enabled people to access the web and to participate in the global information exchange. Notable examples are mobile banking and the ability to provide people with a global platform in order to broadcast their issues during times of unrest and crisis such as the Arab Spring movement. During national and global disasters such as Hurricane Sandy, Fukushima or Typhoon Yolanda, online services such as Google and Twitter have formed crisis response portals in order to co-ordinate and support rescue efforts. Today, surveys indicate that daily internet usage plays a significant role in the everyday lives of consumers in the connected world.

We offer customized research & analysis services. Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores After going through a bit of soft phase at the beginning of 2018, the U.S. dollar has gained quite a bit of value opposite the Euro. Most recently, US$1 was buying 0.9 Euros. This trend is mirrored with many other global currencies and the currencies of U.S. major trade partners. The strength of the dollar has advantages (namely cheaper imports) but there have been many critical of the strong dollar, including U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump said repeatedly that he would support a FED policy weakening the dollar, because it would aid U.S. companies doing business abroad. Currently, businesses who have to convert foreign earnings back into dollars are getting out less and are therefore potentially less competitive. Trump has blamed federal interest rates, which are currently higher in the U.S. but remain at zero in Europe, for the strengthening of the dollar. The unequal rates are in fact a major draw for investors to move assets to the U.S. As more people buy (in) dollars, the demand for the currency goes up, strengthening it. China\u2019s Central Bank, for example, has been accused of keeping its currency artificially low to be very competitive in the global marketplace.

We offer customized research & analysis services. Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores The retail trade industry is responsible for the display and sale of new or used goods to consumers for personal or household consumption. The retail trade division includes motor vehicle retail, fuel retailing, food retailing, and other forms of store-based retail. In the past the sector has seen a rapid reduction in the number of department stores and the rise of supermarkets and shopping centers. More recently, there has been a rise of convenience shopping, online trading, and the growth of franchising. As it has grown the retail trade industry has had to remain flexible to cope with economic challenges, technological advances, consumer trends, new retail formats, globalization and increasing competition. The industry is characterized by a high degree of casual, part time and seasonal employment. It is estimated that more than half of the adult population is either currently working, or has worked at some time in their life, in the retail industry. The world retailing industry is becoming increasingly competitive, forcing companies to take an innovative approach to attract consumers and encourage long-term loyalty. Department stores, for example, are increasing consumer footfalls by replacing more expensive brand-name products with less expensive private-label products. There are many market segments that are fuelling the growth of this industry. For example, the world multi-line retail industry, specialty retail market (products encompassed in the specialty retail industry include computer and electronics, automotive retail, home furnishing retail, apparel retail and specialty stores.), the convenience store industry and the global e-commerce industry are all expected to grow significantly in the next few years especially in emerging markets such as Latin America, the Middle East and Asia. The global e-commerce industry is boosted by wider internet penetration, with about 2.5 billion people using the internet in 2012. Business to consumer e-commerce growth in the U.S. is forecast to slow over the years to come while growth in other regions will gain momentum, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, where sales are estimated to reach approximately 69 billion U.S. dollars. Key players operating in the global retail market include House of Fraser, Galeries Lafayette, Arnotts, Fenwick, Bloomingdale\u2019s, John Lewis, GALERIA Kaufhof, Arcandor, Debenhams, Saks Fifth Avenue, Macy's, Stockmann, Marks & Spencer, Beales, Sears, DWW Woolworth Germany, El Corte Ingl\u00e9s, Dillard's, Roebuck & Company, The Bay, Nordstrom and Maxeda.

Malgr\u00e9 ses 14 participations au Tour de France, Raymond Poulidor n'a jamais remport\u00e9 cette course. Cela n'emp\u00eache pourtant pas les amateurs fran\u00e7ais de cyclisme de le consid\u00e9rer comme le deuxi\u00e8me sportif le plus marquant de cette course. N\u00e9anmoins, il s'est construit un palmar\u00e8s digne des plus grands coureurs fran\u00e7ais. Cette statistique fait \u00e9tat de toutes les \u00e9preuves remport\u00e9es entre 1961 et 1973 par le cycliste d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le 13 novembre 2019. S'il n'est jamais ressorti vainqueur de la Grande Boucle, Raymond \u00ab\u00a0Poupou\u00a0\u00bb a toutefois remport\u00e9 le Tour d'Espagne en 1964. Il comptabilise en outre cinq victoires au Crit\u00e9rium international. Le cyclisme en France Le cyclisme est la cinqui\u00e8me activit\u00e9 sportive des Fran\u00e7ais et sa pratique repr\u00e9sentait plus de 116.000 licences d\u00e9livr\u00e9es en France. Cet int\u00e9r\u00eat pour le v\u00e9lo se traduit cependant peu dans le Tour de France. En effet, pr\u00e8s de trois quart des Fran\u00e7ais se d\u00e9claraient d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9s par cette comp\u00e9tition en 2018 et la moiti\u00e9 ne comptait pas du tout la suivre. Il faut dire que l'image du Tour de France a tendance \u00e0 se ternir au fil des ann\u00e9es, notamment en raison des multiples affaires de dopages. Au cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, il y a eu un recul de 4,7\u00a0% de l'usage de la voiture en \u00cele-de-France, selon une enqu\u00eate men\u00e9e par \u00cele-de-France Mobilit\u00e9s et l'Observatoire de la mobilit\u00e9 en \u00cele-de-France (OMNIL). Le nombre total de d\u00e9placements en voiture dans un jour de la semaine, du lundi au vendredi, s'\u00e9levait en 2018 \u00e0 14,8 millions, ceux dans la petite couronne \u00e9tant les plus nombreux, avec environ 8,5 millions de d\u00e9placements quotidiennement. Les d\u00e9placements en France73 % des Franciliens poss\u00e9daient une voiture ou un autre v\u00e9hicule motoris\u00e9 en 2017, cependant seulement 26 % des Fran\u00e7ais utilisaient leur voiture tous les jours comme conducteurs en 2018, tandis que 13 % de la population fran\u00e7aise effectuaient leurs d\u00e9placements en autobus sur la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode. Les d\u00e9placements des personnes \u00e0 mobilit\u00e9 r\u00e9duite \u00e0 Paris Bien que neuf stations de m\u00e9tro \u00e9taient accessibles aux personnes \u00e0 mobilit\u00e9 r\u00e9duite (PMR) \u00e0 Paris en 2017 et que ce nombre soit rest\u00e9 le m\u00eame au cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, les autres moyens de transport en commun ont augment\u00e9 le nombre d'arr\u00eats et de gares adapt\u00e9s aux personnes souffrant d'un handicap. Mais le transport collectif qui a vraiment agi pour offrir aux PMR une meilleure mobilit\u00e9 dans la Ville des Lumi\u00e8res est le bus\u00a0: de 60 arr\u00eats de bus accessibles aux PMR en 2007, on est pass\u00e9 \u00e0 plus de 430 en 2017. Cette statistique repr\u00e9sente les pr\u00e9visions sur la valeur des transactions dans la technologie financi\u00e8re (Fintech) en France entre 2017 et 2023, selon le segment. Ainsi, on observe que selon l'\u00e9tude men\u00e9e par Statista Digital Market Outlook, le montant transactionnel de tous les segments de la Fintech en France devrait augmenter dans les ann\u00e9es prochaines. La Fintech de nos jours Un fait indiscutable, c'est que l'ann\u00e9e 2018 a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s positive pour le secteur \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle mondiale par rapport aux ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes. Particuli\u00e8rement pour le p\u00f4le RH et paie qui repr\u00e9sentait au deuxi\u00e8me trimestre 2019 pr\u00e8s de 40\u00a0% de la valeur totale des actions des entreprises Fintech dans le monde. Les pr\u00e9visions d'investissements dans la Fintech Les pr\u00e9visions d'investissements dans le secteur pour 2019 s'\u00e9levaient \u00e0 43 milliards de dollars, face aux 37,8 atteints au deuxi\u00e8me trimestre, ce qui se traduit comme un bon signe pour le d\u00e9veloppement de la Fintech. La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 leader du secteur La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 am\u00e9ricaine PayPal se pla\u00e7ait \u00e0 la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode en t\u00eate des entreprises de la technologie financi\u00e8re \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle mondiale, avec une capitalisation boursi\u00e8re de pr\u00e8s de 130 milliards de dollars. Cette statistique illustre la distribution des ventes de programmes audiovisuels fran\u00e7ais en 2017, par zone g\u00e9ographique. En 2017, 49,8 % des ventes de programmes audiovisuels \u00e9taient effectu\u00e9es en Europe de l'Ouest. L\u2019Europe de l\u2019Ouest figurait ainsi en premi\u00e8re place de ce classement devant l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord, notamment gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 des pays tels que l\u2019Allemagne, l\u2019Autriche et l\u2019Italie, o\u00f9 les programmes audiovisuels fran\u00e7ais sont particuli\u00e8rement pris\u00e9s. En 2017, la vente de programmes audiovisuels fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger est avant tout soutenue par les genres de l\u2019animation et de la fiction. En effet, les programmes d\u2019animation \u00e9taient les plus export\u00e9s et repr\u00e9sentaient plus de la moiti\u00e9 de la valeur totale, suivi des programmes de fiction et des documentaires. Les ventes de programmes audiovisuels privil\u00e9giaient \u00e9galement les programmes d\u2019animation en 2017, ce qui en faisait la cat\u00e9gorie la plus populaire cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0. Si les programmes audiovisuels fran\u00e7ais s\u2019exportent bien \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, ils sont \u00e9galement tr\u00e8s populaires sur le territoire fran\u00e7ais. Le chiffre d\u2019affaires annuel de l\u2019industrie audiovisuelle fran\u00e7aise ne cesse d\u2019augmenter et avoisinait 12 milliards d\u2019euros en 2016. Il en va de m\u00eame pour le nombre total d\u2019entreprises du secteur, qui comptait pr\u00e8s de 4.000 entreprises de production audiovisuelle la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e. L'\u00e9tude men\u00e9e par BVA sur les Fran\u00e7ais et les vacances vertes r\u00e9v\u00e8le notamment la part des Fran\u00e7ais pour qui l'empreinte \u00e9cologique joue un r\u00f4le dans le choix des transports pendant leurs vacances en 2019. Cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0, 60 % des personnes interrog\u00e9es prenaient en consid\u00e9ration l'empreinte \u00e9cologique lorsqu'ils devaient choisir un mode de transport pour leurs vacances. Tandis que 12 % d'entre eux ne le prenaient pas du tout en compte. Une conscience \u00e9cologique plus m\u00fbre Papiers laiss\u00e9s par terre, m\u00e9gots sur la plage, sur-consommation d'eau dans les h\u00f4tels et sur-production de d\u00e9chets....les touristes sont loin d'\u00eatre des \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00ab\u00a0\u00e9colos\u00a0\u00bb mod\u00e8les. Cependant, les nombreuses sonnettes d'alarme, lanc\u00e9es ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es sur la gravit\u00e9 de la situation \u00e9cologique actuelle, semblent avoir peu \u00e0 peu \u00e9veill\u00e9es les consciences. Outre les d\u00e9marches mises en place par les acteurs du tourisme, les Fran\u00e7ais r\u00e9fl\u00e9chissent davantage aux choix de leur destination de vacances, aux activit\u00e9s sur place, et \u00e0 leur h\u00e9bergement. 55 % des touristes fran\u00e7ais \u00e9taient \u00e9galement soucieux dor\u00e9navant de consommer des produits locaux et de saison. Mont\u00e9e de l'\u00e9co-tourisme L'\u00e9co-tourisme est un terme qui est apparu d\u00e8s les ann\u00e9es 80 dans le but de prot\u00e9ger l'environnement tout en sensibilisant les voyageurs au cadre naturel ou aux lieux qu'ils visitent et au respect de la culture et des communaut\u00e9s locales. Cette forme de tourisme est devenue attractive en proposant notamment des h\u00e9bergements alternatifs comme la yourte ou la cabane perch\u00e9e en haut d'un arbre en pleine nature. 55 % des Fran\u00e7ais se voyaient bien y aller en couple, et 70 % le temps d'un weekend. Cette statistique montre la part des personnes LGBT (lesbiennes, gays, bisexuels et transgenres) ayant eux-m\u00eames d\u00e9clar\u00e9 leur orientation sexuelle \u00e0 leurs parents en France en 2018. On observe ainsi que la majorit\u00e9 des personnes LGBT avaient annonc\u00e9 leur orientation sexuelle \u00e0 au moins un des deux parents. Cependant, 77\u00a0% des personnes LGBT avaient mis au courant leur m\u00e8re de leur orientation sexuelle, tandis que 69\u00a0% l'avaient annonc\u00e9 \u00e0 leur p\u00e8re. Si la question de l'homosexualit\u00e9 reste taboue dans certains contextes, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise est aujourd'hui de plus en plus ouverte et tol\u00e9rante. Ainsi, s'ils \u00e9taient minoritaires dans les ann\u00e9es 70, les Fran\u00e7ais sont aujourd'hui 85\u00a0% \u00e0 estimer que l'homosexualit\u00e9 est une sexualit\u00e9 normale, au m\u00eame titre que l'h\u00e9t\u00e9rosexualit\u00e9. \u00c0 l'inverse, la proportion de Fran\u00e7ais pensant que c'est une maladie qu'il faut gu\u00e9rir n'a cess\u00e9 de diminuer au fil des d\u00e9cennies. D'ailleurs, 72\u00a0% des Fran\u00e7ais sond\u00e9s ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'ils accepteraient bien l'\u00e9ventuelle homosexualit\u00e9 de leur prog\u00e9niture. Dans ce contexte, donc, il n'est pas \u00e9tonnant de constater que 88\u00a0% des personnes LGBT aient annonc\u00e9 eux-m\u00eames leur sexualit\u00e9 \u00e0 leurs parents. N\u00e9anmoins, si la mani\u00e8re dont les LGBT+ sont per\u00e7us dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 s'est am\u00e9lior\u00e9e avec le temps, certains sujets de crispation (comme le mariage pour tous ou la PMA) demeurent et les membres de cette communaut\u00e9 restent la cible de discriminations.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores On a night where foreign policy and social issues were some of the main topics discussed, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren spoke the most words. According to debate transcripts cited by Bloomberg, Warren spoke 2,400 words at the fifth Democratic debate in Atlanta on November 20. She beat former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg by 100 words. Buttigieg partly earned more talking time because he needed to defend himself against California Senator Kamala Harris, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar and Hawaii Representative Tulsi Gabbard, who all attacked him for his lack of experience and struggle to get support from the black community. Though Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is one of the most popular candidates, he uttered fewer words than most. When he was called on to talk about Medicare, he lamented, \u201cThank you. I wrote the damn bill.\u201d At that point in the debate, Warren had already been asked to speak numerous times. At the bottom of the pack with a word count of 1,300 were Gabbard, Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang. Steyer and Yang, two of the underdogs in the race, even helped each other, with Steyer thanking Yang after he defended him. Harris, who spoke 1,900 words, took the opportunity to speak about paid family leave and gender equality. New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, who hadn\u2019t yet qualified for the sixth debate, challenged Biden on opposing the legalization of marijuana on the federal level. The debate was relatively polite. The candidates were keen to talk about how to defeat President Donald Trump instead of criticizing each other.  This chart shows the word count by candidates at the fifth DNC debate, according to transcripts. Report Statista offers daily infographics about trending topics covering Media and Society.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores Personal loans in the U.S. \u201chave been growing like a weed\u201d, according to Moody\u2019s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi. The Washington Post and Equifax report that outstanding personal loans balances were up by over 10 percent in the last quarter compared to a year ago, which means that more than 20 million Americans have taken out a personal loan at an average balance of over $16,000 each. This rapid growth has been tied to the success of fintech lending products, which arrived at a market share of 38 percent of the personal loan market in 2018 and have likely been growing since. As recently as 2013, that share had been 5 percent. Consumers have been turning to apps because many value the easy application process they offer, according to CNBC. The tendency of Americans to take out more loans does not fit with the fact that jobs and paychecks have been growing in America. Also, the number of subprime borrowers has been overrepresented in the personal loan segment, raising questions to whether customers could pay their rates in the case of an economic downturn. Yet, the personal loan market is smaller compared with credit card and home mortgage debt and a widespread default on loans is not expected to have the same devastating effect the 2008 housing crisis had.  This chart shows shares of U.S. unsecured personal loan balances by provider segment. Report Statista offers daily infographics about trending topics covering Media and Society.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores One of the most marked developments in the field of telecommunications and technology in the last few decades has been enabling people to get in touch with one another quickly, through numerous means, while on the go. Communications and its ever-strengthening connection to mobility has become the most significant telecommunications development of recent years; allowing people to juggle daily schedules, home life and work. Major tech companies like Apple, manufacture such devices and constantly develop them so that they continue to meet new organisational challenges presented during the course of every day life. Statistics dealing with the telecommunication industry display many current and exciting trends in this field. Wireless telecommunication was first achieved with the invention of the radio at the beginning of the 20th century. This revolutionized and significantly sped up communication over long distances, as a new, quick way of sending and receiving information. Telecommunications, in its most basic, simple form consist of a transmitter, a transmission medium or channel and a receiver. Nowadays, however, this lucrative, complex and secretive industry is an ever raging battle for intellectual property, patents, court cases and injunctions. All deemed necessary to retain an edge in the market. Telecommunication statistics on worldwide revenue from telecommunications services paint an interesting picture of the ever-changing, constantly developing industry and include a forecast of developments to come. In 2011, over one trillion euros of revenue was generated in the telecommunications industry. In just three years\u2019 time, this figure is expected to continue to rise and rise. Worldwide revenue from telecommunications equipment also gives an impressive overview of the industry. Back in 2005, revenue stood at 196 billion euros. In 2011, this figure had grown to an astonishing 256 billion euros. In 2014, revenue is expected to further rise to 274 billion euros. The general trend over the years has been in the direction of growth; to date, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any sign of a stall in growth. There are several large telecommunication providers in Europe, among them: Deutsche Telecom, Telefonica, Vodafone, France Telecom, Telecom Italia. As of 2009, Germany\u2019s Deutsche Telecom topped the list with revenue of over 64 billion euros. Spain\u2019s Telefonica followed with over 56 billion. In fact, according to statistics, Europe has consistently shown the highest revenue in telecommunication services by region over the last six years. In 2010, 317 billion euros were spent in this area in Europe, compared to 239 billion in North America. Based on figures on wireless operating revenue of major U.S. telecommunication providers, Verizon led the industry with revenue of over 63 billion euros in 2010. AT&T followed with 58.5 billion euros in revenue. The number of active mobile broadband subscriptions worldwide rose from 73 million to over one billion in the last six years alone. As of September 2011, the number of mobile phone subscriptions was led by China Mobile, which had more than 633 million subscribers, Vodafone in the UK followed with 391 million, while Deutsche Telecom was trailing with 128.5 million.
