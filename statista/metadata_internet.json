Content & Grafik aus einer Hand:  Mehr erfahren KPIs f\u00fcr \u00fcber 10.000 Online-Shops Mehr als 14.000 Unternehmen nutzen Statista Der weltweite Aussto\u00df von Kohlenstoffdioxid nimmt seit 1960 kontinuierlich zu und erreicht im Jahr 2018 seinen bisherigen H\u00f6chstwert von rund 36,6 Milliarden Tonnen Kohlenstoffdioxid. Auch wenn die j\u00e4hrliche Menge an CO2-Emissionen steigt, geschieht dies in den vergangenen rund sieben Jahren in einem deutlich geringeren Ma\u00dfe. Bis zum Jahr 2050 wird ein Anstieg der j\u00e4hrlichen CO2-Emissionen bis zu 43,1 Milliarden Tonnen prognostiziert. CO2-Emissionen in Deutschland Kohlenstoffdioxid entsteht u.a. bei der Verbrennung fossiler Energietr\u00e4ger (wie beispielsweise Kohle, Holz oder Erdgas) und wird den Treibhausgasen zugeordnet. In Deutschland sind knapp 88 Prozent aller Treibhausgase Kohlenstoffdioxid. Haupts\u00e4chlich wird CO2 energiebedingt emittiert, d.h. bei der Verbrennung von Brennstoffen zur Energieerzeugung. Die Landwirtschaft und die Industrie nehmen nur einen geringen Anteil der CO2-Emissionen ein. Negative Folgen der hohen Emissionen Der durch den Menschen verursachte (\u201eanthropogene\u201c) Treibhauseffekt beschreibt u.a. den hohen Kohlenstoffdioxid-Gehalt in der Erdatmosph\u00e4re, wodurch das Entweichen der von der Erde abgestrahlten W\u00e4rme in das Weltall eingeschr\u00e4nkt wird. Daraus resultiert die Temperaturerh\u00f6hung auf der Erde. Die Erderw\u00e4rmung wirkt sich wiederum u.a. auf die Umwelt (z.B. die Artenvielfalt, die H\u00f6he des Meeresspiegels, das Wetter) sowie auf die Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft (z.B. Landwirtschaft, Energieversorgung, Umweltmigration) aus. Die Statistik zeigt die Ver\u00e4nderung des Auftragseingangs im Verarbeitenden Gewerbe gegen\u00fcber dem Vormonat von Oktober 2018 bis Oktober 2019. Im Oktober 2019 verringerte sich das Volumen der Auftragseing\u00e4nge des Verarbeitenden Gewerbes gegen\u00fcber dem Vormonat um ca. 0,4 Prozent. Die Statistik bildet die monatliche Entwicklung des Verbraucherpreisindex f\u00fcr die Personenbef\u00f6rderung im Luftverkehr in Deutschland von November 2018 bis November 2019 ab. Der Verbraucherpreisindex misst die durchschnittliche Preisentwicklung von Waren und Dienstleistungen, die von privaten Haushalten f\u00fcr Konsumzwecke gekauft werden. Der gesamte Verbraucherpreisindex f\u00fcr die Personenbef\u00f6rderung im Luftverkehr Deutschlands lag im November 2019 bei 103. Die Statistik zeigt die Marktanteile der verschiedenen Spielzeugkategorien in Deutschland in den Jahren 2017 und 2018. Baus\u00e4tze hatten im Jahr 2018, wie bereits im Vorjahr, einen Marktanteil von 18 Prozent. Die Statistik zeigt die erreichten Punkte der OECD-Staaten bei der PISA-Studie im Jahr 2018 im Bereich Lesekompetenz. Bei der PISA-Studie im Jahr 2018 erreichte Deutschland eine Punktzahl von 498 im Bereich der Lesekompetenz. Siehe auch die Punktzahlen der OECD-Staaten bei den PISA-Studien von 2000 bis 2015 im Bereich Lesekompetenz. PISA ist die Abk\u00fcrzung f\u00fcr \"Programme for International Student Assessment\". Bei der PISA-Studie werden weltweit Leistungen 15-j\u00e4hriger Sch\u00fcler/-innen erfasst und international verglichen. Das Programm wird von der OECD (Organisation f\u00fcr wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung) aufgelegt. Im Ranking der meistgesehenen YouTube-Videos aller Zeiten belegte das Musikvideo zu dem Song \"Despacito\" von Luis Fonsi featuring Daddy Yankee mit rund 6,55 Milliarden Views den ersten Platz (Stand: 02. Dezember 2019). Auch das Ranking der beliebtesten YouTube-Videos nach der Anzahl der Likes wird von diesem Musikvideo angef\u00fchrt. Bis zum 01. Dezember 2019 vergaben YouTube-Nutzer insgesamt rund 35,59 Millionen Likes f\u00fcr dieses Video. Informationen zu YouTube Das Videoportal YouTube wurde im Jahr 2005 von drei ehemaligen PayPal-Mitarbeitern gegr\u00fcndet und ist seit 2006 eine Tochtergesellschaft von Google. Neben Musikvideos werden auf YouTube diverse weitere Videoarten, wie Trailer, Film- und Fernsehausschnitte sowie selbstgedrehte Videos von YouTube-Nutzern angeboten. Nutzungsgewohnheiten von YouTube in Deutschland YouTube wird von knapp 77 Prozent der Deutschen mindestens selten genutzt. Laut einer PwC-Umfrage wird das Videoportal besonders unter 16- bis 19-J\u00e4hrigen intensiv verwendet. In dieser Altersgruppe liegt die durchschnittliche Nutzungsdauer bei 150 Minuten pro Tag. \u00dcber alle Altersgruppen hinweg bel\u00e4uft sich die durchschnittliche Nutzungsdauer auf 49 Minuten t\u00e4glich.

Cette statistique montre l'opinion des Fran\u00e7ais en fin novembre 2019 quant \u00e0 la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de cette gr\u00e8ve naitonale. Il s'av\u00e8re que la majorit\u00e9 des sond\u00e9s, soit 64\u00a0%, trouvaient ce mouvement justifi\u00e9, contre 36\u00a0% qui le trouvaient infond\u00e9. Le syst\u00e8me des retraites en France Consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme complexe, le syst\u00e8me de retraite fran\u00e7ais est l'un des rares fond\u00e9 sur le principe de r\u00e9partition\u00a0: reposant sur le principe de solidarit\u00e9 entre les g\u00e9n\u00e9rations, les actifs versent chaque mois des cotisations aux caisses de retraite qui les redistribuent aux retrait\u00e9s actuels. Le r\u00e9gime obligatoire combine deux types de retraites (la retraite de base et la retraite compl\u00e9mentaire). Le gouvernement d'\u00c9douard Philippe tient \u00e0 r\u00e9former ce syst\u00e8me, notamment avec la mise en place d\u2019un r\u00e9gime de base par points (sur le m\u00eame mod\u00e8le que la retraite compl\u00e9mentaire) dans lequel le montant de la retraite serait calcul\u00e9 en fonction des points accumul\u00e9s au cours de la vie professionnelle. Par ailleurs, les r\u00e9gimes sp\u00e9ciaux seraient supprim\u00e9s au rofit d'un r\u00e9gime de retraite universel. Pour autant, les Fran\u00e7ais sont 66\u00a0% \u00e0 ne pas faire confiance \u00e0 Emmanuel Macron pour r\u00e9former les retraites. Emmanuel Macron et la contestation S'il n'est pas le seul pr\u00e9sident de la V\u00e8me R\u00e9publique \u00e0 avoir affront\u00e9 une grogne grandissante, M. Macron pourrait bien \u00eatre le chef d'\u00c9tat fran\u00e7ais ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moin des manifestations parmi les plus violentes et les plus \u00e9tir\u00e9es dans le temps. Le mouvement des Gilets jaunes a eu beau s'\u00e9tioler au fil des mois, il a dur\u00e9 huit mois cons\u00e9cutifs. En plus d'une c\u00f4te de popularit\u00e9 inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 50\u00a0%, 76\u00a0% des Fran\u00e7ais trouvent sa politique injuste et 67\u00a0% pensent que les \u00e9lus sont \u00e9loign\u00e9s des pr\u00e9occupations des Fran\u00e7ais. Pourtant, ces pr\u00e9occupations sont nombreuses\u00a0: baisse du pouvoir d'achat, ch\u00f4mage, pr\u00e9carit\u00e9, manque de moyens des h\u00f4pitaux publics, crise climatique... La France est en proie \u00e0 de nombreuses tensions que le gouvernement peine \u00e0 calmer. Organis\u00e9 par l'Association fran\u00e7aise contre les myopathies (AFM), le T\u00e9l\u00e9thon est devenu le plus important \u00e9v\u00e9nement caritatif de l'Hexagone depuis sa mise en place en 1986. Chaque ann\u00e9e, le T\u00e9l\u00e9thon a lieu au cours de la premi\u00e8re ou la deuxi\u00e8me fin de semaine de d\u00e9cembre. Sa diffusion est organis\u00e9e par les m\u00e9dias fran\u00e7ais comme France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions, qui retransmet durant 30 heures une \u00e9mission de marathon tout en regroupant des patients, des scientifiques, des b\u00e9n\u00e9voles ainsi que des artistes\u00a0; tous veulent participer \u00e0 cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement pour la bonne cause. En 2018, la valeur des dons faits par les Fran\u00e7ais et destin\u00e9s \u00e0 lutter contre les maladies neuromusculaires et g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques s'\u00e9levait \u00e0 pr\u00e8s de 86 millions d'euros. Les missions sociales d'AFM-T\u00e9l\u00e9thon en 2018 En 2018, la somme d\u00e9pens\u00e9e par l'Association pour les missions sociales \u00e9tait de pr\u00e8s de 91 millions d'euros. Sur la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode, 54 millions d'euros ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s pour aider \u00e0 financer la recherche de moyens pour gu\u00e9rir les maladies neuromusculaires et g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques. Le but \u00e9tait d'investir dans des th\u00e9rapies innovantes, la pharmacologie et la recherche et le d\u00e9veloppement (R&D). En outre, 34,7 millions d'euros ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 disposition afin d'aider les personnes concern\u00e9es, par exemple, \u00e0 l'accession au diagnostic et au traitement des patients et leurs familles. La charit\u00e9 en France En 2017, le montant des dons effectu\u00e9s par les Fran\u00e7ais s'\u00e9levait \u00e0 2,5 milliards d'euros. Selon une enqu\u00eate men\u00e9e par Odoxa en 2018, environ 8 % des Fran\u00e7ais interrog\u00e9s ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 faire des dons mensuellement \u00e0 des associations ou des fondations, alors que plus d'un quart des Fran\u00e7ais (26\u00a0%) ont fait un seul don au cours de l'ann\u00e9e 2018. Cette statistique repr\u00e9sente le classement des dix joueurs d'e-sport ayant engendr\u00e9 le plus de revenus dans le monde au 26 novembre 2019. Le danois Johan Sundstein, dit N0tail, est arriv\u00e9 en premi\u00e8re position du classement, avec pr\u00e8s de sept millions de dollars engendr\u00e9s au fil de sa carri\u00e8re. \u00c0 titre de comparaison, la canadienne Sasha Hostyn (Scarlett) est arriv\u00e9e en t\u00eate du classement des joueuses avec pr\u00e8s de 350.000 dollars la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e. L'e-sport en France En 2018, pr\u00e8s d'un quart des consommateurs d'e-sport fran\u00e7ais avaient entre 15 et 24 ans, et environ 28\u00a0% de ceux-ci \u00e9taient des femmes. De m\u00eame, plus de 50\u00a0% des joueurs fran\u00e7ais de cette discipline suivaient des comp\u00e9titions du type ar\u00e8nes de bataille et sport. En ce qui concerne le chiffre d'affaires du secteur en France, celui-ci s'\u00e9levait \u00e0 pr\u00e8s de 29 millions de dollars sur la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode. En novembre 2019, la France comptait plus de 900 joueurs de comp\u00e9tition d'e-sport recens\u00e9s. Cette statistique repr\u00e9sente les pr\u00e9visions sur la valeur des transactions dans la technologie financi\u00e8re (Fintech) en France entre 2017 et 2023, selon le segment. Ainsi, on observe que selon l'\u00e9tude men\u00e9e par Statista Digital Market Outlook, le montant transactionnel de tous les segments de la Fintech en France devrait augmenter dans les ann\u00e9es prochaines. La Fintech de nos jours Un fait indiscutable, c'est que l'ann\u00e9e 2018 a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s positive pour le secteur \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle mondiale par rapport aux ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes. Particuli\u00e8rement pour le p\u00f4le RH et paie qui repr\u00e9sentait au deuxi\u00e8me trimestre 2019 pr\u00e8s de 40\u00a0% de la valeur totale des actions des entreprises Fintech dans le monde. Les pr\u00e9visions d'investissements dans la Fintech Les pr\u00e9visions d'investissements dans le secteur pour 2019 s'\u00e9levaient \u00e0 43 milliards de dollars, face aux 37,8 atteints au deuxi\u00e8me trimestre, ce qui se traduit comme un bon signe pour le d\u00e9veloppement de la Fintech. La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 leader du secteur La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 am\u00e9ricaine PayPal se pla\u00e7ait \u00e0 la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode en t\u00eate des entreprises de la technologie financi\u00e8re \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle mondiale, avec une capitalisation boursi\u00e8re de pr\u00e8s de 130 milliards de dollars. L'\u00e9tude men\u00e9e par BVA sur les Fran\u00e7ais et les vacances vertes r\u00e9v\u00e8le notamment la part des Fran\u00e7ais pour qui l'empreinte \u00e9cologique joue un r\u00f4le dans le choix des transports pendant leurs vacances en 2019. Cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0, 60 % des personnes interrog\u00e9es prenaient en consid\u00e9ration l'empreinte \u00e9cologique lorsqu'ils devaient choisir un mode de transport pour leurs vacances. Tandis que 12 % d'entre eux ne le prenaient pas du tout en compte. Une conscience \u00e9cologique plus m\u00fbre Papiers laiss\u00e9s par terre, m\u00e9gots sur la plage, sur-consommation d'eau dans les h\u00f4tels et sur-production de d\u00e9chets....les touristes sont loin d'\u00eatre des \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00ab\u00a0\u00e9colos\u00a0\u00bb mod\u00e8les. Cependant, les nombreuses sonnettes d'alarme, lanc\u00e9es ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es sur la gravit\u00e9 de la situation \u00e9cologique actuelle, semblent avoir peu \u00e0 peu \u00e9veill\u00e9es les consciences. Outre les d\u00e9marches mises en place par les acteurs du tourisme, les Fran\u00e7ais r\u00e9fl\u00e9chissent davantage aux choix de leur destination de vacances, aux activit\u00e9s sur place, et \u00e0 leur h\u00e9bergement. 55 % des touristes fran\u00e7ais \u00e9taient \u00e9galement soucieux dor\u00e9navant de consommer des produits locaux et de saison. Mont\u00e9e de l'\u00e9co-tourisme L'\u00e9co-tourisme est un terme qui est apparu d\u00e8s les ann\u00e9es 80 dans le but de prot\u00e9ger l'environnement tout en sensibilisant les voyageurs au cadre naturel ou aux lieux qu'ils visitent et au respect de la culture et des communaut\u00e9s locales. Cette forme de tourisme est devenue attractive en proposant notamment des h\u00e9bergements alternatifs comme la yourte ou la cabane perch\u00e9e en haut d'un arbre en pleine nature. 55 % des Fran\u00e7ais se voyaient bien y aller en couple, et 70 % le temps d'un weekend. Au cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, il y a eu un recul de 4,7\u00a0% de l'usage de la voiture en \u00cele-de-France, selon une enqu\u00eate men\u00e9e par \u00cele-de-France Mobilit\u00e9s et l'Observatoire de la mobilit\u00e9 en \u00cele-de-France (OMNIL). Le nombre total de d\u00e9placements en voiture dans un jour de la semaine, du lundi au vendredi, s'\u00e9levait en 2018 \u00e0 14,8 millions, ceux dans la petite couronne \u00e9tant les plus nombreux, avec environ 8,5 millions de d\u00e9placements quotidiennement. Les d\u00e9placements en France73 % des Franciliens poss\u00e9daient une voiture ou un autre v\u00e9hicule motoris\u00e9 en 2017, cependant seulement 26 % des Fran\u00e7ais utilisaient leur voiture tous les jours comme conducteurs en 2018, tandis que 13 % de la population fran\u00e7aise effectuaient leurs d\u00e9placements en autobus sur la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode. Les d\u00e9placements des personnes \u00e0 mobilit\u00e9 r\u00e9duite \u00e0 Paris Bien que neuf stations de m\u00e9tro \u00e9taient accessibles aux personnes \u00e0 mobilit\u00e9 r\u00e9duite (PMR) \u00e0 Paris en 2017 et que ce nombre soit rest\u00e9 le m\u00eame au cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, les autres moyens de transport en commun ont augment\u00e9 le nombre d'arr\u00eats et de gares adapt\u00e9s aux personnes souffrant d'un handicap. Mais le transport collectif qui a vraiment agi pour offrir aux PMR une meilleure mobilit\u00e9 dans la Ville des Lumi\u00e8res est le bus\u00a0: de 60 arr\u00eats de bus accessibles aux PMR en 2007, on est pass\u00e9 \u00e0 plus de 430 en 2017.

This includes, for example, information on restaurants, restaurant chains, food services, hotels, business and leisure travel, holiday destinations and activities, camping, and the cruise industry. The travel & tourism sector has developed into an industry with an annual economic impact (direct, indirect and induced) of around 6.5 trillion U.S. dollars worldwide. In 2012, the number of international tourist arrivals exceeded the one billion mark for the first time, an increase of almost 50 percent compared to ten years earlier. International travelers from China, Germany and the United States are amongst the biggest spenders worldwide. The global hotel industry generates approximately between 400 and 500 billion U.S. dollars in revenue each year, one third of that revenue is attributable to the United States. Some of the biggest hotel chains (groups) are the InterContinental Hotels Group, Marriott International, Hilton Worldwide, Accor, Starwood Hotels & Resorts, and the Wyndham Hotel Group. Three of the most important hotel performance indicators are the Average Daily Rate (ADR), the revenue per available room (RevPar), and the occupancy rate. The hospitality and restaurant industry is a diverse and highly competitive industry. Among the competitors in the industry are single sandwich shops, coffee shops and restaurants, coffeehouses, pizza and quick-service restaurant chains, and also high-end, luxury fine-dining restaurants, offering the customer a vast variety of choices. Estimations put the overall revenue from food and drink sales in the United States at more than 600 billion U.S. dollars. Major players in the industry include McDonald\u2019s (limited-service segment) with more than 34 thousand restaurants worldwide, the coffeehouse chain Starbucks \u2013 with more than 19 thousand stores worldwide \u2013 and Domino\u2019s Pizza in the pizza chain segment.

In November 2019, the mobile version of the popular battle royale game, Fortnite, generated daily revenue of over 387 thousand U.S. dollars from iPhone users in the United States. The rise of Fortnite First released in 2017, Fortnite is a battle royale game which pits up to 100 players against one another in a fight to the death. The mobile version of the game has proven to be extremely popular and has been met with critical acclaim. The app was nominated for both Mobile Game of the Year at 2018 Golden Joystick Awards and Best Mobile Game at The Game Awards 2018. It has also achieved commercial success as it grossed 455 milion U.S. dollars on the Apple App Store worldwide in 2018, amounting to a daily average revenue of 1.6 million U.S. dollars. With the number of registered Fortnite users worldwide continuing to rise, it appears that Epic Games' number one hit shows no signs of slowing down. Online app stores With individual gaming apps generating millions of dollars of revenue on a daily basis, it is no surprise that app stores are also raking in the revenue. In 2018, Google Play Store recorded gross revenues of 21.5 billion U.S. dollars from mobile games, up from 17.3 billion generated in 2017. The numbers for Apple's App Store were even more impressive, with revenue from mobile games on its iOS platform reaching 33.2 billion U.S. dollars worldwide in 2018. Interestingly, despite Apple's App Store leading the way in terms of revenue, Google Play recorded significantly more mobile game downloads in 2018. A total of 38.3 billion mobile games were downloaded globally across both app stores in that year, out of which the vast majority, 29.4 billion downloads in total, were attributed to Google Play.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores One of the most marked developments in the field of telecommunications and technology in the last few decades has been enabling people to get in touch with one another quickly, through numerous means, while on the go. Communications and its ever-strengthening connection to mobility has become the most significant telecommunications development of recent years; allowing people to juggle daily schedules, home life and work. Major tech companies like Apple, manufacture such devices and constantly develop them so that they continue to meet new organisational challenges presented during the course of every day life. Statistics dealing with the telecommunication industry display many current and exciting trends in this field. Wireless telecommunication was first achieved with the invention of the radio at the beginning of the 20th century. This revolutionized and significantly sped up communication over long distances, as a new, quick way of sending and receiving information. Telecommunications, in its most basic, simple form consist of a transmitter, a transmission medium or channel and a receiver. Nowadays, however, this lucrative, complex and secretive industry is an ever raging battle for intellectual property, patents, court cases and injunctions. All deemed necessary to retain an edge in the market. Telecommunication statistics on worldwide revenue from telecommunications services paint an interesting picture of the ever-changing, constantly developing industry and include a forecast of developments to come. In 2011, over one trillion euros of revenue was generated in the telecommunications industry. In just three years\u2019 time, this figure is expected to continue to rise and rise. Worldwide revenue from telecommunications equipment also gives an impressive overview of the industry. Back in 2005, revenue stood at 196 billion euros. In 2011, this figure had grown to an astonishing 256 billion euros. In 2014, revenue is expected to further rise to 274 billion euros. The general trend over the years has been in the direction of growth; to date, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any sign of a stall in growth. There are several large telecommunication providers in Europe, among them: Deutsche Telecom, Telefonica, Vodafone, France Telecom, Telecom Italia. As of 2009, Germany\u2019s Deutsche Telecom topped the list with revenue of over 64 billion euros. Spain\u2019s Telefonica followed with over 56 billion. In fact, according to statistics, Europe has consistently shown the highest revenue in telecommunication services by region over the last six years. In 2010, 317 billion euros were spent in this area in Europe, compared to 239 billion in North America. Based on figures on wireless operating revenue of major U.S. telecommunication providers, Verizon led the industry with revenue of over 63 billion euros in 2010. AT&T followed with 58.5 billion euros in revenue. The number of active mobile broadband subscriptions worldwide rose from 73 million to over one billion in the last six years alone. As of September 2011, the number of mobile phone subscriptions was led by China Mobile, which had more than 633 million subscribers, Vodafone in the UK followed with 391 million, while Deutsche Telecom was trailing with 128.5 million.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores This page provides statistics, facts and market data related to mobile internet and apps. This includes information on segments and industries such as mobile internet usage, market reach, device usage, app reach as well as statistics on demographics and use. Mobile internet refers to the use of internet-connected applications and browsing the web on mobile devices. For many years internet access has only been possible with a fixed line. In the last couple of years however, mobile internet use has moved out of the niche and onto the mass market. As of 2013, almost a third of website traffic originated from mobile devices. Currently, more than 100 million users in the United States access the internet via tablet or smartphone. Furthermore, the number of mobile-only internet users worldwide is expected to close in on half a billion users. Apple set the bar for future smartphones when it released the first iPhone in 2007. In 2010, Apple introduced the iPad and has since been dominating the tablet market as well. Google followed suit, releasing the Android OS which is currently the most popular smartphone operating system on the planet. The Apple App Store and Google Play are also the leading mobile app stores worldwide and account for over 90 percent of worldwide app revenues. Between the two competitors, Google Play\u2019s market share is steadily growing and has doubled within the previous year. Mobile internet usage statistics show that users spent most of their online time writing and reading emails. Other popular activities include social networking, catching up with news and current events, mobile gaming, and mobile media consumption via content streaming apps such as Netflix or Spotify. The popularity of mobile internet has created a new market for advertisers as well. Mobile advertising revenues are growing quickly and mobile advertising is expected to grow into a billion-dollar business in the next few years.

Whether or not you are a customer, and whether or not any agreement even exists between us, is irrelevant in this case. By providing you with this information, we aim to make the manner in which we handle your data transparent for you. 1. Data controller The controller within the legal sense for all data-related issues is the company named in the \u201cLegal notice\u201d section of our website. You can contact one of the company representatives named there or our Data Protection Officer: Rechtsanwalt Maximilian Conrad Raabestr. 1 10405 Berlin Germany A Data Protection Officer is not bound to management\u2019s instructions. You can also contact him/her by e-mail: dataprotection@statista.com. 2. Procedure and purpose of storage Your computer sends us your IP address when you use our websites and, depending on the type of use and your computer\u2019s settings, we may store small text files (\u201ccookies\u201d) on your hard drive. We create these files to improve the function of our website for you. It is a sort of short-term memory on your browser. We also create text files on our system that may contain the following information about you: The type and version of your browser, the operating system used, the URL of the website from which you came to ours, the name of your computer and the time (\u201clog files\u201d). The log files cannot be directly linked to specific individuals. We do not combine this data with cookies or IP addresses. However, we reserve the right to evaluate this data retroactively in individual cases where we have specific indications that such data is being used unlawfully. The log files help us to understand on what types of computer our websites have to function properly and at what times our websites are visited more (or less) frequently. With the information provided by these files, we can adjust our website structure, servers and database systems accordingly. If you set up a user account with us or enter into a contract with us as a customer (e.g. goods order, newsletter subscription), we create a customer account in our system. This includes the master data provided by you, your order details and, where necessary, your accounting details (\u201ccustomer data\u201d). We store and process this data, because we would otherwise not be able to perform the contract with you. If you send us a job application, we will use all of the information provided on it to process your application. If your application is rejected, your data will be deleted six months after notification of this rejection, unless you have given us prior permission to contact you again. If you are employed by our company, your application documents, master data, accounting data and insurance data will be stored for the purpose of performing the employment relationship and forwarded to the partner companies listed below to the extent that such is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of the employer. 3. Forwarding the data to third parties We do not process all of your data by ourselves, but use the programs and services of other companies (\u201ctools\u201d). We will change the tools we use from time to time, where it makes sense to do so for legal, technical or economic reasons. We currently use the following tools for the management and provision of data (particularly customer data, IP addresses, cookies and log files): \u2022 Google Analytics (records number of visitors to the website) \u2022 Amazon web services (website operation, server location) \u2022 Datev (master data management, accounting) \u2022 Personio (HR management) \u2022 HRworks (travel expense accounting) \u2022 Microsoft Exchange server (contact data, emails) \u2022 Mailchimp (contact data, emails to large groups) \u2022 Contact Monkey (email tracking) \u2022 Userlike (provision of service chat windows on the website) \u2022 Slack (in-house communication) \u2022 Stripe (payment processing) \u2022 Nfon (internal and external calls) \u2022 Limesurvey (expert surveys) If you do not consent to the use of these tools, we may no longer be able to perform contracts concluded between us, or may have to switch to solutions that are less convenient for you. We will only forward your data to providers or storage locations in countries outside the European Union to the extent that such is necessary to process orders and perform contracts. 4. Deletion periods We will retain your data until such time as the order has been completed or the statutory retention periods have expired. These are defined, in particular, in Section 27 HGB (German Commercial Code), where the retention periods for business documents are regulated. 5. Information You have the statutory right to request information on the data stored by us at any time. In spite of our endeavors to ensure that data is correct and up-to-date, should we have stored incorrect data relating to you, we will correct said data as quickly as possible at your request. Where you have given your consent to data processing, you may withdraw it at any time with effect for the future. 6. Supervisory authority If you feel that we have failed to meet our obligation to inform, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (e.g. the Data Protection Officer of a German Federal State). 7. Voluntary provision of data You are not obligated to provide us with your data. You may, therefore, refuse to have your IP address saved. In order to conclude and perform contracts between you and us, the processing of your data in the scope described above is, however, necessary. If you withdraw your consent to data processing, this shall render performance on our part impossible, although this shall not release you from your obligation to perform. (For this reason, you may not object to the storage of your customer data in the above-mentioned management systems until such time as the contractual relationship has ended). 8. Alternative purpose If we intend to process your data further for a purpose other than that for which you made the data available to us, we shall provide you with specific information on this alternative purpose and the reason why we intend to use your data for it. You may withdraw your consent to further processing at any time. Click here for a free PDF reader.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores This page provides statistics, facts and market data related to social media as well as user-generated content. This includes information on segments and industries such as social networks, content creation and curation, social apps as well as statistics on demographics and use. Currently, there are more than 1.6 billion social network users worldwide with more than 64 percent of internet users accessing social media services online. According to statistics, social networking is one of the most popular ways for online users to spend their time, enabling them to stay in contact with friends and families as well as catching up with news and other content. Current industry data indicates that more than half of the internet users in North America are social network users. In the United States, these figures amount to more than 160 million users who access social networking sites via any device at least once per month. In mid-2013, Facebook accounted for more than half of all social media site visits in the United States, placing it first among the most popular social network ranking, followed by Google-owned video site YouTube and Twitter. With more than 1.1 billion monthly active users, Facebook is also the most popular social network worldwide. Despite Facebook being the absolute market leader in terms of MAU, other social networks have thrived nonetheless. Some social networks such as LinkedIn have specialized in professional networking, whereas others such as Chinese-language Qzone or Renren cater to huge local audiences. A wide selection of social networks also heavily relies on user-generated content: image-heavy Tumblr, Instagram and Pinterest are home to content-creating and digitally curating users. The spread of smartphones and tablets has lead to the increase of mobile social networks. According to market data, social media marketing and social commerce are also two up-and-coming industries with strong revenue potential.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores This page provides statistics, facts and market data related to internet. This includes information on segments and industries such as social media, online search, user-generated content, online advertising and marketing as well as statistics on demographics and use. Current internet user figures suggest that there are more than 2.5 billion users worldwide with a global penetration rate of 35 percent with North America accounting for 14 percent of global internet users. Since the late 1990s, the internet has not only provided users with online experiences such as email, online search and general browsing but has also played a major role in enabling human interaction and reshaping traditional communications media such as film, television, music and telephone. The mainstreaming of internet features, such as digital music and video, user-generated content and digital media sales, have caused traditional media consumption to undergo significant changes. With the large-scale offerings of user-generated as well as licensed content in the forms of audio, video, games and writings, companies such as YouTube, Netflix, Spotify, Pandora and Tumblr have broadened the selection of available entertainment and enabled internet users to interact more closely with the media and each other. The emergences of new digital technologies and websites have accelerated forms of human interaction through online forums, instant messaging, and social networking (since the mid-2000\u2019s). Email has been a staple of the online experience. However, the rise of social networks, most notably market leader Facebook, and mobile social apps such as Twitter, LINE or WhatsApp have changed the notion of online communications and the divide of the personal and public online space. Facebook has more than 1.2 billion monthly active users, presenting a global reach of almost 50 percent of internet users worldwide. According to internet market data, online sales via B2B and B2C e-commerce have not only expanded the reach and volume of traditional wholesale and retail trade but have also changed entire business infrastructures across various industries. The reach of online commerce has also enabled small and independent business owners to pursue their business ventures across local borders. Market data suggests a steady growth of global digital buyer penetration. Online shopping is not the only way of making money via the internet \u2013 statistics suggest a growth of digital content sales via e-commerce platforms such as iTunes, Google Play or Steam as well as the vast market of online advertising and marketing. Global companies such as Google, Amazon and Baidu generate the majority of their revenues via online services. Whereas the majority of internet access used to be via a fixed-line connection to a desktop PC, the growth of mobile technologies such as WiFi and laptops as well as mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers have completely changed the online landscape. In countries with weak technological infrastructures, mobile internet has enabled people to access the web and to participate in the global information exchange. Notable examples are mobile banking and the ability to provide people with a global platform in order to broadcast their issues during times of unrest and crisis such as the Arab Spring movement. During national and global disasters such as Hurricane Sandy, Fukushima or Typhoon Yolanda, online services such as Google and Twitter have formed crisis response portals in order to co-ordinate and support rescue efforts. Today, surveys indicate that daily internet usage plays a significant role in the everyday lives of consumers in the connected world.

Con excepci\u00f3n de 2015, la puntuaci\u00f3n de Espa\u00f1a en lo que respecta a la comprensi\u00f3n cient\u00edfica de sus estudiantes de Secundaria se ha situado siempre por debajo de la media de la OCDE. Ahora bien, llama especialmente la atenci\u00f3n el resultado obtenido en la \u00faltima edici\u00f3n del informe, ya que en 2018 el pa\u00eds obtuvo un total de 483 puntos. Un dato que no solo coloca al pa\u00eds a seis puntos de la media, igual\u00e1ndolo a Estados como Lituania y Hungr\u00eda, sino que supone adem\u00e1s un descenso de diez puntos respecto al informe anterior y alcanza as\u00ed el peor resultado del periodo de estudio.

Tras la entrega del Bal\u00f3n de Oro 2019 a Lionel Messi, el argentino se coloc\u00f3 en primera posici\u00f3n con seis trofeos. Con ello adelant\u00f3 a Cristiano Ronaldo, que qued\u00f3 en segunda posici\u00f3n. Johann Cruyff, Michel Platini y Marco van Basten, con tres, compart\u00edan la tercera posici\u00f3n. La estad\u00edstica presenta el n\u00famero de nominaciones a los Premios Goya 2020, por pel\u00edcula. \"Mientras dure la guerra\" fue el largometraje m\u00e1s nominado en la edici\u00f3n n\u00famero 34 de los galardones otorgados por la Academia de las Artes y las Ciencias Cinematogr\u00e1ficas de Espa\u00f1a. A la pel\u00edcula de Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar le sigue, muy de cerca, \"Dolor y Gloria\", con 16 nominaciones. La edici\u00f3n 2020 de los Premios Goya se vislumbra, as\u00ed, como la gran batalla de dos grandes figuras del cine nacional como son los directores Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar y Pedro Almod\u00f3var. Esta estad\u00edstica muestra la evoluci\u00f3n anual del n\u00famero de casos diagnosticados con infecci\u00f3n del VIH en Espa\u00f1a de 2003 a 2018. El n\u00famero de casos de infecci\u00f3n por VIH se increment\u00f3 considerablemente hasta el a\u00f1o 2018, en el que se registraron m\u00e1s de 3.250 casos.

En 2014, se celebraron la primeras 29 marchas silenciosas con el objetivo de dar voz a un tema poco conocido en la sociedad moderna por la falsa creencia de que la esclavitud es un tema obsoleto. Desde entonces estas caminatas, bajo un lema que no es sino la traducci\u00f3n de su nombre original en ingl\u00e9s \"Walk for freedom\", no han hecho sino crecer hasta aproximarse a las 500 marchas en m\u00e1s de 50 pa\u00edses en 2018.

Starting Wednesday September 11 (Android) and Friday September 13 (iOS), Dutch residents were able to sign up for free for an early version before its release in the US, Canada and the Netherlands on November 12. Thanks to figures provided by Priori Data, it is possible to get an idea of how the new video streaming service launched in the European country. In the first week (from September 13 up until September 20), the Disney+ app reached nearly 200,000 downloads. The source does not mention whether one download equals single person use or whether multiple persons in a household, such as children, use the app alongside their parents. In 2018, there were around 7.8 million households in the Netherlands. Why the Netherlands  Three main reasons are mentioned why the Netherlands became the test ground for Disney's video service. First, the country had relatively many high-speed internet connections. Second, the Netherlands is quite used to Video on Demand (VoD) as can be seen in the market size of Netflix and other domestic VoD services versus DVD and Blue-ray sales. Netflix's revenue in the Netherlands, for example, grew from 120 million euros in 2015 to 220 million euros in 2018. Finally, the Netherlands has no issues with the English language. This can be seen in, for example, the podcast listening behavior of Dutch consumers in 2019 and their preference for podcasts that were either partially or fully in English. To Infinity, And Beyond  As of 2018, the Walt Disney Company's total assets were worth over 98 billion U.S. dollars. In the same year, the media company and owner of Pixar Studios, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic generated a global revenue of 59.43 billion U.S. dollars, the highest figure to-date. The company is divided in five different segments: Studio Entertainment, Parks and Resorts, Disney Consumer Products, Media Networks (which includes ABC, Disney Channels, ESPN, Hulu), and Disney Interactive. Streaming service Disney+ could make the high reach of \"the House of Mouse\" even bigger.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores The retail trade industry is responsible for the display and sale of new or used goods to consumers for personal or household consumption. The retail trade division includes motor vehicle retail, fuel retailing, food retailing, and other forms of store-based retail. In the past the sector has seen a rapid reduction in the number of department stores and the rise of supermarkets and shopping centers. More recently, there has been a rise of convenience shopping, online trading, and the growth of franchising. As it has grown the retail trade industry has had to remain flexible to cope with economic challenges, technological advances, consumer trends, new retail formats, globalization and increasing competition. The industry is characterized by a high degree of casual, part time and seasonal employment. It is estimated that more than half of the adult population is either currently working, or has worked at some time in their life, in the retail industry. The world retailing industry is becoming increasingly competitive, forcing companies to take an innovative approach to attract consumers and encourage long-term loyalty. Department stores, for example, are increasing consumer footfalls by replacing more expensive brand-name products with less expensive private-label products. There are many market segments that are fuelling the growth of this industry. For example, the world multi-line retail industry, specialty retail market (products encompassed in the specialty retail industry include computer and electronics, automotive retail, home furnishing retail, apparel retail and specialty stores.), the convenience store industry and the global e-commerce industry are all expected to grow significantly in the next few years especially in emerging markets such as Latin America, the Middle East and Asia. The global e-commerce industry is boosted by wider internet penetration, with about 2.5 billion people using the internet in 2012. Business to consumer e-commerce growth in the U.S. is forecast to slow over the years to come while growth in other regions will gain momentum, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, where sales are estimated to reach approximately 69 billion U.S. dollars. Key players operating in the global retail market include House of Fraser, Galeries Lafayette, Arnotts, Fenwick, Bloomingdale\u2019s, John Lewis, GALERIA Kaufhof, Arcandor, Debenhams, Saks Fifth Avenue, Macy's, Stockmann, Marks & Spencer, Beales, Sears, DWW Woolworth Germany, El Corte Ingl\u00e9s, Dillard's, Roebuck & Company, The Bay, Nordstrom and Maxeda.

We offer customized research & analysis services. Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores In this section, statistics and market figures relating to the consumer goods industry are presented. Consumer goods are goods which are intended for everyday private consumption. They cover a large product portfolio including food and non-food categories in order to meet consumer demand. They are further classified in fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) and slow moving consumer goods (SMCG). The definitions are based on how fast products are sold to the customer, a determining factor in the rotation of goods. FMCG are goods with a useful life shorter than a year and include product categories such as food and beverages, personal care, household and cleaning products, apparel and footwear, tobacco and pet food/pet care which are products bought relatively frequently with recurring expenditure. SMCG are goods with a useful life longer than a year comprising items such as household appliances, furniture and home improvement products. These items have a lower sales frequency and are not rotating as rapidly as FMCG. The competitive landscape of the consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry is shaped by global leading CPG companies such as US-based Procter & Gamble (P&G), Unilever, L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Nestl\u00e9. Many companies invest large amounts of money for the development of new products in accordance with recent market trends and the latest research findings. As many manufacturers operate globally, product packaging and labeling regulations have to be fulfilled in order to meet the country-specific requirements. In addition, product formulas may have to be adapted to suit different consumer tastes.

Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores This page provides statistics, facts and market data related to cyber crime. This includes information on segments such as fraud, hacking, cyber bullying and electronic harassment, cyber warfare as well as statistics on demographics. Cyber crime or computer crime can be divided into two categories: the first comprises crimes that target computers directly such as viruses, attacks and malware; the second focuses on online crime that uses computer networks or devices as means to perform fraud and identity theft through social engineering as well as cyber bullying, cyber stalking and cyber warfare. Currently, companies in the United States experience an annual loss of more than 525 million US dollars due to cyber crime with the majority of these losses stemming from malicious code and denial of service attacks. Data breaches and their consequences have also had profound effects on consumers with personal information and credit details being stolen. The biggest online data breach compromised more than 130 million user accounts. Online brands with the highest chance of being targeted by phishing attacks include online payment provider Paypal and online auction house eBay, as well as numerous online service providers that require personal identification as well as payment information. With the ubiquity of the internet, an increased online usage and the spread of social network usage throughout all age groups, cyber bullying and cyber stalking have become increasingly common, especially among teenagers. Cyber bullying is defined as the harming or harassing of other people in a deliberate, repeated, and hostile manner, including cyber dating abuse within relationships.

We offer customized research & analysis services. Content Marketing & Information Design for your projects:  More Information KPIs for more than 10,000 online stores In this section, Statista presents the most relevant and up-to-date facts relating to the transportation and logistics industries. Today, there is a plethora of transport modes around the world, the most dominant ones being road and rail transport, as well as ship transport and aviation. Global passenger demand is on the rise both in mature and emerging markets, where the population is becoming increasingly affluent and mobile. Despite the growing number of bicycles, motorcycles, coaches, trains, planes and even cruise ships in use, the automobile is still the most popular form of passenger travel. Thanks to the car\u2019s popularity, the automotive industry has made a strong comeback from the 2008 financial crisis. Toyota, General Motors and VW are ranked as the largest passenger car manufacturers worldwide. The Volkswagen Group is also counted among the world\u2019s leading truck manufacturers, trailing only Germany\u2019s Daimler and China\u2019s Dongfeng. In terms of cargo transportation, trade relations between China, North America and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) are forecast to drive up traffic demand over the coming years. While cargo aircraft are often used to transport mail, animals and dangerous items, bulk products are typically carried by railways, trucks and ships. In the logistics industry, intermodal freight traffic is the most common choice to move consumer goods. Intermodal transport facilitates and expedites cargo traffic because the freight is shipped in containers that move interchangeably by commercial vehicles, railroads and container ships.

This includes information on segments and industries such as search engine usage, market reach, search volume as well as statistics on demographics and use. Online search is one of the most popular web activities worldwide. Internet users can search for information on the World Wide Web using search engines or global search portals such as Google, Yahoo and other local variants such as Yandex, Baidu or Naver. The results are usually presented on search engine result pages with items ranked by relevancy and other factors determined by the search engines search algorithm. Google is the worldwide search market leader with a constant global market share around 90 percent. In the United States, Google is also ranked first among unique visitors and core searches. Recent online search figures indicate heavy online search usage in European countries. Web search is frequently used during online travel planning or product research and has been vital in the growth of mobile commerce and smartphone shopping. Current statistics show that shoppers use their mobile devices to utilize online search before and during shopping, as mobile search helps them find opening hours, pricing comparisons and product information. Mobile search on smart devices has thus become a fixed part of brick-and-mortar retail. To increase the visibility of their products and appear at the top of search engine results, companies have to optimize their websites through SEO, short for search engine optimization.

Whether or not you are a customer, and whether or not any agreement even exists between us, is irrelevant in this case. By providing you with this information, we aim to make the manner in which we handle your data transparent for you. 1. Data controller The controller within the legal sense for all data-related issues is the company named in the \u201cLegal notice\u201d section of our website. You can contact one of the company representatives named there or our Data Protection Officer: Rechtsanwalt Maximilian Conrad Raabestr. 1 10405 Berlin Germany A Data Protection Officer is not bound to management\u2019s instructions. You can also contact him/her by e-mail: dataprotection@statista.com. 2. Procedure and purpose of storage Your computer sends us your IP address when you use our websites and, depending on the type of use and your computer\u2019s settings, we may store small text files (\u201ccookies\u201d) on your hard drive. We create these files to improve the function of our website for you. It is a sort of short-term memory on your browser. We also create text files on our system that may contain the following information about you: The type and version of your browser, the operating system used, the URL of the website from which you came to ours, the name of your computer and the time (\u201clog files\u201d). The log files cannot be directly linked to specific individuals. We do not combine this data with cookies or IP addresses. However, we reserve the right to evaluate this data retroactively in individual cases where we have specific indications that such data is being used unlawfully. The log files help us to understand on what types of computer our websites have to function properly and at what times our websites are visited more (or less) frequently. With the information provided by these files, we can adjust our website structure, servers and database systems accordingly. If you set up a user account with us or enter into a contract with us as a customer (e.g. goods order, newsletter subscription), we create a customer account in our system. This includes the master data provided by you, your order details and, where necessary, your accounting details (\u201ccustomer data\u201d). We store and process this data, because we would otherwise not be able to perform the contract with you. If you send us a job application, we will use all of the information provided on it to process your application. If your application is rejected, your data will be deleted six months after notification of this rejection, unless you have given us prior permission to contact you again. If you are employed by our company, your application documents, master data, accounting data and insurance data will be stored for the purpose of performing the employment relationship and forwarded to the partner companies listed below to the extent that such is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of the employer. 3. Forwarding the data to third parties We do not process all of your data by ourselves, but use the programs and services of other companies (\u201ctools\u201d). We will change the tools we use from time to time, where it makes sense to do so for legal, technical or economic reasons. We currently use the following tools for the management and provision of data (particularly customer data, IP addresses, cookies and log files): \u2022 Google Analytics (records number of visitors to the website) \u2022 Amazon web services (website operation, server location) \u2022 Datev (master data management, accounting) \u2022 Personio (HR management) \u2022 HRworks (travel expense accounting) \u2022 Microsoft Exchange server (contact data, emails) \u2022 Mailchimp (contact data, emails to large groups) \u2022 Contact Monkey (email tracking) \u2022 Userlike (provision of service chat windows on the website) \u2022 Slack (in-house communication) \u2022 Stripe (payment processing) \u2022 Nfon (internal and external calls) \u2022 Limesurvey (expert surveys) If you do not consent to the use of these tools, we may no longer be able to perform contracts concluded between us, or may have to switch to solutions that are less convenient for you. We will only forward your data to providers or storage locations in countries outside the European Union to the extent that such is necessary to process orders and perform contracts. 4. Deletion periods We will retain your data until such time as the order has been completed or the statutory retention periods have expired. These are defined, in particular, in Section 27 HGB (German Commercial Code), where the retention periods for business documents are regulated. 5. Information You have the statutory right to request information on the data stored by us at any time. In spite of our endeavors to ensure that data is correct and up-to-date, should we have stored incorrect data relating to you, we will correct said data as quickly as possible at your request. Where you have given your consent to data processing, you may withdraw it at any time with effect for the future. 6. Supervisory authority If you feel that we have failed to meet our obligation to inform, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (e.g. the Data Protection Officer of a German Federal State). 7. Voluntary provision of data You are not obligated to provide us with your data. You may, therefore, refuse to have your IP address saved. In order to conclude and perform contracts between you and us, the processing of your data in the scope described above is, however, necessary. If you withdraw your consent to data processing, this shall render performance on our part impossible, although this shall not release you from your obligation to perform. (For this reason, you may not object to the storage of your customer data in the above-mentioned management systems until such time as the contractual relationship has ended). 8. Alternative purpose If we intend to process your data further for a purpose other than that for which you made the data available to us, we shall provide you with specific information on this alternative purpose and the reason why we intend to use your data for it. You may withdraw your consent to further processing at any time. Click here for a free PDF reader.
